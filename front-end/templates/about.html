<p>The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has hindered our ability to replicate and audit the behavior of emerging artificial intelligence systems. These hindrances have opened the door to unintended consequences like unexpected biases, unethical behavior, and unequal access to these systems.</p>

<p>TuringBox is a two-sided marketplace that facilitates both the behavioural study of artificial intelligence systems and the production of new, socially-aware systems.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3><b>1. What is machine behavior?</b></h3>
    <h4>Machine Behavior is an emerging interdisciplinary field concerned with the scientific study of machines, not as engineering artifacts, but as a class of actors with their own unique behavioral patterns and ecology. It overlaps with, but is distinct from computer science and robotics, because it treats machine output observationally and experimentally, without necessarily appealing to the machineâ€™s internal mechanisms (which is how behavior is defined for social scientists). <br><br>
     Machine behavior can range from <a href = "https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">uncoving bias in important, high stakes algorithms</a> to <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02597-8">understanding the way in which algorithms cooperate</a>. 
     You can learn more about <a href = "http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/machine-behavior-needs-to-be-an-academic-discipline">the concept </a> published on The Nautilus</a>, or read  <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02597-8">Cooperating with Machines</a>, one of the technical papers in the discipline published in Nature Communications.</h4>

     <h3><b>2. Where does the name "TuringBox" come from?</b></h3>
    <h4>We are inspired by animal behaviorists who, in the 1930s, pionereed the study of animals in controlled environments. These boxes enabled tight control of conditions, easy replication, standardized stimuli and measurement. We aim to put algorithms in a similarly controlled environment, thus promoting the study of their behavior.</h4>

    <h3><b>3. What is a box?</b></h3>
    <h4>A box is a fundamental unit of TuringBox. It constitutes a stimulus, AI systems, and a way of measuring them. This is depicted in red, yellow and blue respectively in our logo. As an examiner, you can create a box to study the AI systems. As a contributor, you can view boxes people have launched and help add algorithms to them.</h4>
