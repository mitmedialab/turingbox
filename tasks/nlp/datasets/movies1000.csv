"Synopsis : On the daily trek from Juarez , Mexico to El Paso , Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert . Investigative reporter Karina Danes Minnie Driver arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth . Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela Ana Claudia Talancon survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue . Her story is further enhanced when the `` Wounds of Christ '' stigmata appear in her palms . She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area . Critique : Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism , miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata , I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez ' . The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns , the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U . S . Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population . I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds . `Virgin of Juarez ' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again , but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing . Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela . Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen Braveheart .",m,0
"THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez , Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso , Texas . The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light , but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director . Karina Danes Minnie Driver is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple in the hundreds killings of young women . The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work , raped , beaten and killed . Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies , in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US . She meets Father Herrera Esai Morales and a community activist Patrick Angus MacFadyen and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder , discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela Ana Claudia Talanc & oacute ; n , a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary . A father of one of the victims , Isidro Jorge Cervera , Jr . nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital , placing her in a 'church ' where she becomes a 'saint ' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end . Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims ' families . Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators , taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men ' from the police office of Detective Lauro Jacob Vargas , and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez . Fearing for Mariela 's life , they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story . The squeaky , mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson . Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism , the story would possibly have been better related . There are some good performances by Driver , Talanc & oacute ; n , Morales , and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality . Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema . It is sad when script and the production dull the impact .

"Mexican men are macho rapists , gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats . Mexican women are semi-pagan , pious fools . There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy , culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter . The story is absurd , the characters are unbelievable , the stereotypes are offensive .",m,0
"Over the past few years , public television has put on a series of vintage & quot ; Doo Wop & quot ; and Rock 'N ' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless . This latest dvd & quot ; Rock , Rhythm And & quot ; Doo Wop & quot ; , is a total delight to ones ears . Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era , when vocal talent was essential , to get a recording contract ? They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology , which enables many modern day artist 's with limited ability to survive ? This dvd reads like a who 's who of early rock . The architect of rock , Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of & quot ; Keep-A Rockin & quot ; , and the line-up that follows , keeps this concert at a premium level of performances . You get to see and hear Lou Christie , Little Anthony and the Imperials , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Joey Dee and the Starliters , Frankie Valli , Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours , just to name a few . However , nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans ? After singing & quot ; This Magic Moment & quot ; , Jay gave a performance , that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again . As he prepared to sing & quot ; Cara Mia & quot ; , he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25 , and must now at age 62 , hit those same notes ? Hit those notes he did ! Using that opera trained voice , he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it 's feet , showering him with a well deserved standing ovation . If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50 's and 60 's , this is an absolute must have dvd . I highly recommend this to everyone , who enjoys those golden oldies .",m,1
"I recvd this video DVD version as a Christmas gift . I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like , and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning . It 's the best `` Oldies '' video I 've ever seen . It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60 's , and they 're still great - Jay and the Americans , Lou Christie , The Five Satins , Little Richard , Kathy Young , Little Anthony , The Fleetwoods , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts . These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing , and it all shows . It 's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh , PA , and distributed around the country to donors . They mention that this was the third concert , and I want ALL of them . Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced . The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect , and truly celebrates their works . The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews .",m,1
"I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs , and was anxiously waiting for Rock , Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive . From the first video , which featured the cr & egrave ; me de la cr & egrave ; me of the 50s groups , to Doo Wop 51 , it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production . Better lighting , better stage layout , and better sound quality . Sadly , in terms of editing , they went overboard this time . Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me . There are times where you can hardly hear the singing , because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud . Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater . It 's simply too artificial . We want not only the authentic groups , but also the authentic reaction from who was there . And believe me , we do n't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups . For whoever edited the show , I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups . Is this DVD worth buying ? Definately , because groups singers Fred Parris & amp ; The Satins , Little Anthony & amp ; The Imperials , Little Richard , The Limelites , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Bobby Lewis , and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile . I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this , they 're a wonderful experience for all ages .",m,1
Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD 's you will ever see . It is done with class and a great respect for the talent . Congratulations to T . J . Lubinsky the producer . Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today . the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on & quot ; Two Kinds of People In The World & quot ; is worth the price alone . I have played this piece over and over . All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through .,m,1
The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all ! It is just great ! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there . After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51 . What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past ! You will never regret buying this DVD .,m,1
"I have all of the doo wop DVD 's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones . Remember once these performers are gone , we 'll never get to see them again . Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you 'll LOVE this DVD ! !",m,1
"As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51 , both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way . Frankly , I thought Little Richard 's appearance was a little pointless , and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford 's Sea Cruise , both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show . It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times , but hit them he did . I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of `` Two Kinds of People in the World '' , and Jay Black and the Americans ' performance of Cara Mia at the very respectable age of 62 is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it . I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold , which appears on all three shows , does n't get a performance of their own , because they are good . This is an excellent addition to anyone 's DVD library . Some notes here : all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers . There are five or six on Doo Wop 50 , ten on Doo Wop 51 , and ten or twelve on this one , but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances , of which there are four . There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case , but whoever designed that put them in random order , not as they appear on the DVD . The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows : Keep A Knocking - Little RichardSea Cruise - Frankie FordA Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the InnocentsSilhouettes - The RaysDo You Love Me - ContoursHave You Heard and You Belong to Me - DupreesPeppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the StarlightersFor Your Love - Ed TownsendRomeo and Juliet - ReflectionsLightning Strikes - Lou ChristieTears on My Pillow , Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop , Two Kins of People in the World , Hurt So Bad , and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the ImperialsSince I Fell for You - Lenny WelchTossing and Turning - Bobby LewisMr .

"well , this just goes to show why you do n't blindly accept a critics review . I own a yellow lab 2 and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic . Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack would have been fatal if not for yellows actions . It is a very heartwarming story without being predictable and just fantastic views . The heck with critics . Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing .",m,1
"You do n't have to be a kid to enjoy this film . This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy . It has something for everyone . Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama . A few scary moments for the young ones , but nothing they ca n't handle . A few sprinkles of romance . Lots of dog-boy bonding . The ending is predictable for all but the very young , but delightful nonetheless . Best of all , it 's just a delightful movie free of violence , car chases , shoot-outs and antagonists ! This movie was engaging from start to finish . On par with < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000065V3A '' > The Journey of Natty Gann < a > and < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B00006ZXSI '' > A Walk in the Clouds < a > .",m,1

"Growing up in the Pacific Northwest , young Angus McCormick Jesse Bradford has learned many survival skills . He 's just finishing up a nice canoe . And when he finds a stray dog , he adopts him and names him Yellow . Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad , John Bruce Davison , on a supply run seems like a dream come true . But when they encounter a fierce storm , the boat they are in capsizes . John is quickly rescued , but the search and rescue teams ca n't find any trace of Angus or Yellow . The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization . Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family ? This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare . It is a little slow at times , especially in the beginning while things are set up . It is fairly predictable . But it is entertaining . Kids will enjoy it more than their parents . My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes . Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly , never giving any plot point time to be fully developed . At the same time , I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying . The film could have been much better but does grow on you . Do n't rush out to see it , but there 's no reason to avoid it either .",m,0
Our family really enjoys this movie . The story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job . Beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged . Should be on DVD . We 'll add it to our collection .,m,1
I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out . It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion . Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending of Course . I am Disney 's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others . P . S . I am a Grandmother to eleven . Thank heavens for Disney Movies .,f,1
"I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film . Unfortunately I did n't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers . Ca n't quite put my finger on it , but perhaps I did n't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this . Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason ; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds . Also it seemed that they did n't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog . The movie is short ; not even 1 1 2 hours . It 's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring . The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog ca n't be rescued , but do n't worry as it has a happy ending . It 's an okay movie , but I expected a lot more . I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy like Shrek II . This is definately one mainly just for the kids . So many things that kids ca n't or should n't watch . This is one that anyone can watch , which is a big plus . Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials .",m,0
"This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen . The acting was n't good , it was very predictable , and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary . The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home , his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy . If you want predictable , watch a survival movie . What happens , almost always , is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident , they struggle to survive , they are found , and then brought home . `` Far From Home '' is no exception . As for unnecessary , the whole `` romance '' part of this movie was badly done and not needed . The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home , and all the while , the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse . Also some parts of this movie might upset young children , such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow ca n't be rescued . All in all , I would not advise anyone to see this movie ; in fact , I would warn against it .",f,0
"I wo n't claim to know all of the rappers that are contained in the movie but it is a good laugh much as `` Car 54 where are you ? `` with Rosi O is . Plus , Dennis Leary is great and `` Duff '' from MTV VJ around 1990-91 also makes a cameo . . . . . very cute ! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh . MJ",m,1
"Very good movie . And unlike many Chinese movies , it does not have a totally sad ending where everyone , especially the hero , gets killed !",m,1
"Recording with an audience of less than 1 , 000 , this DVD feels like a club recording with it 's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound . Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request ' gimmick is not original . Still , it manages to captivate . Fifteen songs one a medley of eight , five being from the last album , it 's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies . & quot ; She Keep On Coming & quot ; and & quot ; You Should Be Dancing & quot ; rock the house , while & quot ; Sacred Trust & quot ; and & quot ; How Can You Mend A Broken Heart & quot ; lull the audience into a trance . This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins ' and lots of joking around . Its surprising to hear Barry sing , & quot ; Woman In Love & quot ; , but & quot ; Nights On Broadway & quot ; is , once again , cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work . < p > This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning . & quot ; One Night Only & quot ; is a great live recording as well , but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation .",m,1
"This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous ! It was even fun listening to the request call-ins . Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live . Love those guys ! ! Also , they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts . I highly recommend this DVD !",f,1

You will have to see this for yourself . If you have viewed any of the others , Hope is a must view as well . There really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing Hope . Also there is no statement that can tell you the experience of owning all four to share with others . You never know when you may encounter someone who may need what is in this series and you to can use this series to win souls , and bring someone out of the darkness and into the light .

"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for escaping from worldly work . Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out although too brief for me in historically correct detail . Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas ' book , the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits .",f,1

"Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on , use a great director , pick great locations , assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors , and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay , and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be . Adventure , mystery , romance , action sequences , character and plot development , and humor are all combined into a masterpiece . The 1 , 000 page book by Dumas is , of course , a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like . The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways . Incredibly , the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending . I ca n't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel . The screenplay is perfectly balanced . If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark , the action so blurred , the characters so poorly developed , and the plot so weak that you are n't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen , you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand . The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn . Caviezel just could n't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life . Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune , played by the late Richard Harris , and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him . Without giving any more of the plot away , let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has . Available in several formats , and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years , I definitely recommend this movie highly . Five stars .",m,1
"I should have read the book by now ! That 's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version -- the only movie version I 've seen so far . The cast is okay , though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating . The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively , and I totally understand Dantes ' sp ? desire for revenge , although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all .",f,1
The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it . The price was good and so was the delivery . Happy with the order .,m,1

"This is a well done movie of my favourite story to date . There 's some time spent in France and then it 's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now . Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one . This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see . Boy has girl , boy has a friend , boy has his dreams come true . . . boy doing there . . . who me Tarzan ? While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it 's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day . Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing . The sets are over the top . There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms .",m,1

I have never read the book , but , I probably will now . There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists . I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly . In addition , the young man that played Jim 's son must be his brother , cousin , etc in real life because he looks just like him . The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying .",f,1

"The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years . I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try . However , both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel . He 's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous , yet calculated revenge . I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the `` bigger '' names . Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie ! In my opinion , it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far .",f,1
"Based on the Dumas story , this fabulous adventure about a naive , illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance , is well written with wit and intelligence , and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film . The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular , though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky . The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch , and adds a lot to the film . < p > The cast : Jim Caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the Dantes Count character ; believable both as the innocent Edmund and the worldly Count of Monte Cristo , with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant style . Richard Harris as the priest who mentor Dantes is marvelous ; wily and wise , it 's a perfect part for Harris , and he makes the most of it . Other standout performances come from Guy Peerce as Fernand , Michael Wincott as Armand Dorelac , the Warden of d'If , and most of all , Luis Guzman as a very funny Jacopo . < p > This is terrific family viewing , free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years . This film will feed your brain , delight your eyes , and raise your heartbeat a little with its fast-paced exploits about & quot ; kings and pawns , emperors and fools & quot ; .",f,1

"Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature ? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now . The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination . It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance , intrigue , sword fights , action . Definitely a movie to add to your collection .",f,1
"I 'll admit , I 've not read the original source novel on which this is based the only thing by Dumas I have read , is the classic 'Musketeers ' ; life is too short to read every great novel , try as one might - but having seen this film , I am determined to seek out the text . Judging the film on its own terms , I found this immensely satisfying , and though quite long 131 min , it does not drag for a second . The story itself is really quite something , and no matter how many films you have seen , or books you have read , you will be absolutely bowled over as George Bernard Shaw was by the breadth , depth , simplicity and universality of it . There are some minor faults with the film ; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted eg . Guy Pearce , an Australian who has mastered a range of accents , seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain : Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in 'Gangs of New York ' . There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion , no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with 'Barry Lyndon ' Kubrick , this is still a riveting , assured adaptation . These are very minor quibbles , and I would put this in with some of my favourite films , along with 'Captain Blood ' Errol Flynn , 'Koyanisquaatsi ' , 'New Cinema Paradiso ' and 'Celebration ' aka Festen . Generally , the script is absolutely top notch , full of little throw-away quips and putdowns . The cast is absolutely stunning , especially James Calaziel , absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger . Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate . Very highly recommended , for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock .",m,1
"A film by Kevin Reynolds < p > This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas 's classic novel `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it , but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it , I was willing to give it a chance . Good thing , because this is a pretty good movie . < p > The story , if you are not familiar with the source material , follows Edmond Dantes Jim Caviezel . Dantes , in the film , is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego Guy Pierce trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying . The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled , and while they get help , Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal , and innocent , letter to a friend . Dantes agrees . Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter , though we do see his fianc & eacute ; Mercedes Iguanada Dagmara Dominczyk and a little bit of Mondego 's jealousy . Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason . That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all . The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years . < p > This is where the movie truly begins . Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes , and he wants his revenge , though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison . While in prison , Dantes meets Abbe Faria Richard Harris , a man who is digging a tunnel slowly , inch by inch to escape . Faria trains Dantes in the sword , teaches him how to read , science , literature , politics , and how to be a noble . He also tells Dantes of a treasure , the treasure of Monte Cristo , that may or may not exist . < p > We would n't have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge , so I 'm not spoiling anything by revealing that . Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo Luis Guzman . Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge . < p > The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit , but this film is good enough , and slick enough , and entertaining enough , that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch . No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel , especially not a 1000 page novel . With the amount of time allotted this film , `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' succeeds at being an entertaining film .",m,1
"I read the 'Monte Cristo ' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it , so I was really pumped up to see it on screen . First off , the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film . BUT , I have to take points off for the ending . Whenever a book is made into a movie , the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually . My issue was not just that the ending was changed , it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book ! It was totally ridiculous ! It was exactly what you would expect to happen , even though it was totally unrealistic . That 's why I gave it only three stars . If you 're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience , it 's a wonderful film . I suggest that you read the book first , see the movie , and judge for yourself . Or if you 've already seen the film , go read the book anyway and see what you missed .",f,0
I very much enjoyed this iteration of the Count . It was well filmed and well acted . It makes a person think of what they would do if they suddenly got very rich and had blood enemies . Would you seek revenge or would you be fat and rich ? Guy Peirce gives a wonderful performance . Rent this movie you will like it and probably want to purchase it .,m,1
"This movie was truly amazing ! Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count , and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy . The cenimatography was beautiful , and while it was long , you love every minute of it . There are some well done action sequences with quickened framework that adds to the tension and the adaptation from the novel while forced to leave a lot out , obviously . . . the book is insanely long ! is far better than most works of this sort . It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore the same as Mask Of Zorro , in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out , so if you 're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere and it 's well worth your while !",m,1
Amazing movie . I saw it in a huge tv screen after hooking up my computer in my tv . The quality was amazing and the speed just perfect like a DVD .,m,1
"BEST MOVIE EVER . Love the book , love the movie . You ca n't go wrong with this classic , so I would definitely recommend it !",m,1
I have always loved this movie and now I can see it on the go ! The picture quality is awesome ! U wo n't regret gettin this movie,f,1
I rented this movie to have a small idea of what it was about because I was monitoring the homework of a 9th . grader tasked with reading the book and answering questions . It seems to have followed the book fairly closely . At least I could ask relative questions . It was well worth the rental fee .,m,1
I have watched this movie numerous times . I have always enjoyed the overall theme of this movie . I will probably watch it again .,m,1
"In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available . I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work . WRONG ! This superbly made film of the Dumas ' novel is excellent and gripping on every level . The quality of the film , shot in Ireland and Malta , is visually stunning , the story remains true to the original , and the cast is outstanding . James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role , aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce , the veteran Richard Harris , the here venomous James Frain , a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman , and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk . The movie is beautifully paced , the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport , and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well . This is a beautiful period piece , finely photographed and scored and edited and directed . For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually , treat yourself to an evening with The Count !",m,1
"If you have never discovered the wonderful world of Alexandre Dumas , I urge you to run , not walk to the local library or bookstore and obtain a copy of `` Le Comte de Monte Christo . `` I also recommend reading the unabridged version of this classic tale about a man who takes revenge on his enemies . One thing is certain : do not attempt to take the lazy way out by watching this adaptation of Dumas 's novel . Two hours will never be enough time to adequately express the majestic beauty of this novel written by a phenomenal storyteller . Having said that , I enjoyed immensely this version of the story starring Jim Caviezel , Guy Pearce , and Richard Harris . Period pieces are often fun to watch , and this one is no exception . With a few problematic exceptions , `` The Count of Monte Christo '' is an entertaining film . < p > The tale , if you are not familiar with it , focuses on a French sailor named Edmond Dantes . On a trading trip back to Marseilles , Dantes had the misfortune to stop at the island of Elba , the home of the exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte . With his captain dead , Dantes arrives in port and is promptly promoted to become the new captain . This step up in status angers several people around Dantes , specifically Danglars , Villefort , and Mondego . The three conspire to have Edmond arrested on charges of treason and thrown into a political prison called the Chateau D'If . Dantes spends years suffering in solitary confinement , although he eventually meets an elderly prisoner named Faria who educates him while they plan their escape . Moreover , this prisoner tells Edmond about a fabulous treasure that could be his for the taking . Eventually , Dantes escapes and embarks on a series of adventures that finds him returning to seek revenge against his enemies under the name `` Le Comte de Monte Christo . `` < p > This very short description of Dumas 's novel obviously leaves out much of the plot . It also highlights the inherent difficulties in translating `` The Count of Monte Christo '' into a two-hour film . There is just too much detail , characters , and sub-plots in the novel to work with . The revenge plots Dantes formulates against his enemies alone are of such length and complexity that it would take hours to encapsulate them on the silver screen . Throw in the sub-plot of the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa who does appear in the film , which is of immense importance in the novel , and it is impossible to adequately convey the full majesty of this classic on celluloid . Fortunately , this film manages to entertain while retaining key elements of the written story . < p > The first part of the movie hews closely to the novel with a few notable exceptions . The film begins with Edmond and his friend Mondego landing on Elba , where they have a shoot out with British security forces before personally meeting the deposed emperor . Back in Marseilles , we meet Mercedes , Dantes girlfriend and a character who plays a big role in the written story . The filmmakers do insert a warden for Chateau D'If , played by actor Michael Wincott , who does not appear in the book . If you are familiar with Wincott , you will remember his voice and his presence . He makes a great addition here and has the best lines in the film . < p > By the time Dantes returns to society as the Count , the film diverges wildly from the story . The revenge Edmond seeks here is too pat and too easily resolved . In the book , his vengeance is intricately planned and executed slowly over many , many pages . By shortening this sequence , the filmmakers sacrifice the suspense of the novel to time constraints and a waning attention span common in today 's moviegoers . To be fair , the movie never tries to be a literal interpretation of the book or so says screenwriter Jay Wolpert in an interview on the disc . In some ways , deviating from the book does make the story more compelling . The sword fights are great fun to watch , especially the final showdown between Dantes and Mondego . The scene where Dantes provides a way out for Villefort and then pulls back at the last second is a nice touch as well . Overall , although I think more elements of the book should have been kept in the story , the movie succeeds . < p > Many extras on the disc make this well worth picking up . There is a short documentary about Alexandre Dumas , a location documentary , four deleted scenes with commentary , a film commentary from director Kevin Reynolds , a detailed explanation on how the sword fights were shot and choreographed , and an interview with writer Jay Wolpert . The picture quality and sound is top notch . I recall that this film disappeared from the theaters quickly , perhaps due to an aversion for period pieces or competition from one of those effects laden clunkers they foist on us every few months . I found `` The Count of Monte Christo '' entertaining and technically well done , and would certainly view it again .",m,1
"This most recent adaptation of Alexandre Dumas ' classic novel is n't going to please all the fans , particularly those who demand rigorous adherence to the source material I never did understand such people 's way of thinking ; a movie is never bad just because it strays from the source but it most certainly will please moviegoers in the mood for a period piece adventure , and as such a film , The Count of Monte Cristo never fails to entertain for every bit of its running time . < p > Jim Caviezel stars as Edmond Dantes , a rather poor and uneducated man who has a life that his rich friend , Fernand Mondego Guy Pearce envies . Dantes has just been promoted to captain of his ship after he and his crew returned from a brief , unanticipated stop in Elba , where Napoleon had given Dantes a letter to give to a `` friend . `` Mondego is particularly jealous that Dantes ' fiancee is Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk , their childhood friend who has grown into an utterly beautiful woman . < p > Mondego sets out to destroy Dantes life by telling French officials of the letter , which leads to Dantes ' arrest . He is banished in a prison located on an island rather far from the mainland . As the years pass , another prisoner , Faria Richard Harris , actually tunnels his way into Dantes cell . With his help , Faria believes they can dig to the outer wall , and in return , he will teach Dantes how to read , write , and fight with a sword . As soon as he makes his escape , Dantes plans his vengeance against those who betrayed him . < p > There 's actually a LOT more plot than what I 've stated , which probably already sounds hefty , but there are a lot of things I 'd rather not give away . While not without some flaws , The Count of Monte Cristo is rousing entertainment and is probably the best period piece adventure in recent years personally , I found it more enjoyable than The Patriot , Rob Roy , and The Last of the Mohicans . < p > The film 's first seventy minutes represent marvelous entertainment , consistently gaining momentum with every scene that goes by as we grow more and more compelled by the story . The film stumbles only slightly in the third act , when Dantes eventually encounters all those who destroyed his life so many years ago , and sets in motion a plan for his own vengeance . It 's in this lengthy segment that a few moments drag but only a few and some scenes feel a little hard to swallow that Pearce 's Mondego would n't recognize Dantes . The climax feels a little silly , in that seemingly all the lead characters pop out from nowhere to either fight or reveal long-held secrets . < p > But thankfully , such flaws are only mild and hardly detrimental . This is a well-acted , well-written , and surprisingly well-directed tale of revenge . As Dantes , Caviezel excels , making a believable transformation from a kind-hearted , innocent man to one whose heart has been hardened through so many years . Guy Pearce chews the scenery quite well as Mondego ; he seems to be having a great time playing the greedy antagonist . It 's nice to see that Pearce , who usually plays likable characters as in L . A . Confidential and The Time Machine , is up to the task of giving us a villain to hiss at . < p > The other performances are n't quite as vital , though Richard Harris is good as Faria , and Luis Guzman is often hilarious as Dantes ' right-hand man the scene where Guzman tells Dantes how to handle the massive amounts of gold they just found is the biggest laugh I 've had all year . Dagmara Dominczyk is pretty decent , though her acting is mostly overshadowed by her beauty , a back-handed compliment , I suppose . < p > The Count of Monte Cristo actually does n't feature that much in the way of adrenaline-pumping action . Despite all the claims this is a swashbuckler , there are only three swordfights and one knifefight , and each of these scenes last no longer than maybe two minutes . But the appeal of this film is n't in the action , it 's watching a plot that unfolds with little twists and turns that , though often expected , engaged me because I cared about the situation and the fate of the characters . < p > There was obviously a lot of work put into the way this film looks . The cinematography is gorgeous and the sets are magnificent , with splendor I have rarely seen rendered so well in period pieces . The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds , who may yet have a career again after his critical disaster , Waterworld which actually was n't half-bad . Highly recommended , The Count of Monte Cristo is great fun all the way . **** 1 2 out of *****",m,1
"I have read the unabridged Count of Monte Christo book at least 4 times and can quote many of the scenes and dialogue . However I am not a literalist when it comes to Hollywood , because movies are not a literary medium . The best we can hope is that Hollywood captures the essence of the book , which I believe the makers of the Count of Monte Christo have done - and done very well . While I agree that it is not a faithful retelling of Dumas ' original , it is a fine film that captures the heart of Dumas ' message : Vengeance is , and should be the Lord 's . < p > Ultimately , Dumas ' novel was about the ravages of revenge , both to the avenger and to his victims . Director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert 's celluloid rendition captures that message in a way that is both entertaining and beautiful . Unlike many Hollywood films these days , this one has charm and heart , which allowed me an avid movie buff to overlook its occasional imperfections . < p > Jim Caviezal plays the tortured Count with aplomb . His metamorphosis from guileless youth into the brooding , devilish Count is convincing . No small feat considering young and old Dant & egrave ; s are polar opposites . < p > Guy Pearce plays the treacherous libertine , Mondego , with a light , foppish touch , making the character all the more frightening . His lines are the best in the film , vicious and manipulative , but delivered with sardonic self-composure . < p > Richard Harris was the right choice for the Abb & eacute ; Faria . During Dant & egrave ; s ' bleak imprisonment , Harris lightens the screen with his earnest optimism and sharp wit . He is more animated than in his recent role as Dumbledore in Harry Potter , even fencing with Caviezal , despite his advanced age . < p > Dagmara Dominczyk is lovely as Mercedes , but of course lacks the vapid self-immolation of the character in the novel . Hollywood loves tidy endings so she is reunited with Dant & egrave ; s while the Persian princess , Haidee , Dant & egrave ; s ' real paramour at the end of the novel is not in the film . Still , Dominczyk 's elegant grace is winning , despite the weepy dialogue she is sapped with . She and Caviezal are what movie stars should look like . < p > Luis Guzm & aacute ; n is fun as the Count 's dutiful sidekick , Jacopo . Not surprisingly , he is the film 's comic relief and acts as a bridge between our generation and Napoleonic France . His lines are more modern slang than classical prose , but it works , especially with Guzm & aacute ; n 's East L . A . lilt . < p > Reynold 's and Wolpert had no easy task - adapting one of the world 's favorite stories to the Big Screen . Of course , the novel is a much more complex and philosophical work than the film , and that is to be expected . A true adaptation would likely be 4-5 hours long . And , yes , they have taken liberties with the book - the ending especially . Still , the movie stands on its own as a stirring and inspiring tale of treachery , romance , revenge , and repentance . It is one of my favorite movies ever , and that 's saying something , since I hate almost everything . Buy it . You wo n't be disappointed .",f,1
"This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo . It does n't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others . It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas . < p > The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes . A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit . He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If . thats not how you spell it but it 's close enough for me It 's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature , economics , and swordplay . Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail . < p > This is a great story of revenge . Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes . He does a great job . He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he 's rich . He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character . I 'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future . < p > Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego . I was first impressed with Pearce in L . A . Confidential . It 's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again . He plays a great bad guy . You ca n't stand his character and that 's because Pearce plays him so good . < p > This is an awesome tail of revenge . If your a diehard Dumas fan you wo n't like this . I 'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you . However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you . It 's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies : To Be Entertained . You 'll like this one .",m,1
"I purchased this dvd for two reasons . One , I 've read the book many times , and it is a classic . I have seen many of the other productions , and I wanted too see how this one compared . Two , I am a BIG fan of Jim Caviezel , and wanted to see his portrayal of the Count . I was not disappointed on either count ! It was timely and acting very well done . I had seen this when it first came out , but seeing Person of Interest every week , I decided to buy the Count . Great dvd fora fan !",f,1
Arrived withing the time period listed . DVD had popped loose from post inside case probably occurred during shipping and disc was slightly scratched . Played fine and have no complaints .,m,1
"I received a copy of this for my birthday , and I love it . This copy is great . The colors seem much more vivid and the sound much better . I think I could watch this over and over but never grow tired of it . Some people have complained about the movie because it does n't follow the book close enough . I agree that it does n't follow the book closely , but that should n't detract from one 's love for the movie . The full book is 1100 pages . It would be impossible to put that into a single movie . They would have to make it 3 separate films like Atlas Shrugged is being done . This one is totally worth it .",m,1
"This is a very good DVD , romantic and somewhat historical . It takes place around the time of Napolean 's exile . I have watched this many times and have shared it with teenagers , who also love it .",f,1
What is so wrong with making a movie and changing the story or plot a little . As if Dumas ' books are sacred writ . . . so many struggle to find any value in an adaptation . If you ask me this movie was far more entertaining than either the book or any of the earlier films of the same title . I enjoy a great rewrite .,m,1
"Great movie ! Enjoyable to watch and see how cleverly the hero exacts his revenge . Not as good as the book but similar . Well made , great acting , one you can watch again and again !",m,1
"This CD was very good . The view of the movie was good , and it came in a timely fashion . I really enjoyed watching this movie . Thank you .",f,1
"I really enjoyed this movie . Does not follow the book really , but thats ok because I felt the movie was better . Overall , very enjoyable .",m,1
"This was the first movie I viewed with Jim Caveizel acting . I thoroughly enjoyed the plot , writing , and acting . It is an excellent story of redemption and justice . It has long been a favorite with our Family !",m,1
"Great Movie , I had seen it years ago and wanted to see it again and it was just as good the secound time around .",f,1
"This is a great movie . My wife watches it over and over , about 7 times now .",m,1
"The movie is excellent in all respects ; however , the company , MovieMars , is not . First they sent an unusable CD due to it being the wrong Regional area . Then when I sent it back , at the expense of $ 5 . 43 mailing fees , they refused to reimburse me for the postage . They refunded the original fee for the CD , but not the postage for return fee . They claimed I should have known what Region I am in and which CD would or would not work on my machine . Well -- I have been renting , buying , and borrowing CDs for about 15 years and have never had this experience before . I believe the CD they sent was meant for foreign markets and they should have known which one to send due to my return address . Anyway -- they were nasty about it , and until I get the postage refunded to my Visa account , I will not be ordering from them , for sure , and probably not from Amazon . After all , Amazon is the company that is truly in charge here . Thank you .",f,1
"Good movie but ends differently from the book . Had I not read the book , I would have enjoyed it more . I bought the VHS used at a very good price . I was very pleased .",m,1
"You can place this in that `far better than I remembered it being ' category . `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is fun , exciting , intelligent and suspenseful , far more than I expected it to be and far better than I remembered it . Having recently indulged in this forgotten gem once again , I 'm finding myself kind of giddy . This movie is fun . If you are into the classic adventure films like `Swiss Family Robinson ' and `Robinson Caruso ' , this film is right up there and certainly just as engaging . You know , my initial dislike for this movie was probably plagued by a heavy dose of bias . My parents lauded it , and so that is usually sparks an initial reaction of discomfort . I mean , I pride myself on having better cinematic taste than they do , and so when they recommend something to me I 'm usually hesitant . Still , they saw the movie twice in the theater and encouraged me to accompany them on their THIRD trip to the movies . I begrudgingly accepted the invitation . Now , mind you , I do n't think that Guy Pearce or Jim Caviezel are great actors . Capable , yes , but no where near `great ' . I think that also clouded my appreciation for this film . I was also merely sixteen when this film was released , so I kind of have an excuse for judging films with sharp bias . Still , I did enjoy the film enough to buy it later on a whim and I 've watched it several times since then . Upon my most recent viewing I found the film elevating drastically for me . The film tells the tale of Edmond Dantes , a middleclass sailor whose friend , the wealthy Fernand Mondego , is surprisingly jealous of Edmond 's good fortune . He has recently been promoted to captain of his vessel and has become engaged to his girlfriend , the ravishing Mercedes . Spurned on by his jealousy , Fernand betrays his friend , concocting an elaborate and viscous scheme that lands Dantes imprisoned in the torturous Chateau d'If . While in prison he bonds with a fellow prisoner who teaches him to fight , as well as articulating him , teaching him to read and write and converse as a gentleman . Then he informs him of a hidden treasure and tells him the location . Once Edmond finds a means of escape he uses his newfound knowledge to create a disguise , allowing him to exact revenge on the men responsible for his loss of thirteen years in prison . With ravishing and passionate performances , stunning visual prowess and a sharply constructed script that breathes an air of believability in a premise that is undoubtedly far-fetched , `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is nothing short of grade-A entertainment and serves as further proof that first impressions are n't always correct .",m,1
Arrived quickly and excellently packaged . DVD in even better condition than description . Very happy .,f,1
"And even though the above quote is not taken from this movie , it did remind me a lot of it as I was watching this film . I could see this movie plenty of times and not get bored of it thanks to its clever script and wonderful acting by all personnel . You probably know by now what `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is all about so I will not bore you with the subject matter of the film . But what I will say is , if you enjoy seeing the enemy get no mercy -not necessarily getting killed- and thriving for vengeance at its best with witty `traps ' , then there is no exception for you to miss out on this movie .",m,1
"While this film may not make it into the `` classic '' category , I 've surely seen a lot of movies which were much , much worse . This one is colorful , well-acted , and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas ' 1200-page novel . Of course , as any screenwriter has learned , it 's not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film . Therefore , entire swathes of the novel 's plot wind up in the waste-basket , characters are blended together , and so on . The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count Edmond Dantes and Mercedes . In the novel , the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways . As I recall , Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent , while Edmond frees his `` Greek slave '' and marries her . In this movie , Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss . There is no `` Greek slave '' -- - she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff , including the lesbian runaways . I really think and hope that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson 's `` Lord of the Rings '' -- - or from the TV mini-series . Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame : they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story . Of course , that 's just me sayin ' . : - This is a good movie ! But it could have been a lot better !",m,1
One of my favorite movies of all time . James Caviezel is excellent in his role as the count . Set on revenge for a serious injustice he ends up with some good fortune that runs his way while in prison . Sets the rest of the movie to plot against the very men that caused his demise . Great Movie !,m,1
"the disk of the dvd i bought was in good condition but i waited quite a while for it to get to me , so that is my only complaint with this purchase",m,1
"having read this book in grade school , it made a huge impression on me . . . so how great to find this film three decades later and share with my daughter . thought the execution was fantastic , and the departures from the script did not bother me , though i do plan to grab a copy of the book and re-read it . highly recommended .",m,1
"My order was shipped so quickly , it was great . I received the movie with no complications which is not always true when ordering things off the internet .",f,1
I was at work when a coworker told me about this movie and that it was really good . So being the fact that I am always looking for a good movie I ordered it from my work computer . Upon watching the movie I was very happy with my dissension to buy it . Since it was old it worth more buying than renting . The movie it self is very detailed and very satisfying . The ending felt like an ending where some movies I 've seen just leave me saying That was a waste of time I would recommend this movie to anybody it has action for myself and drama the my wife really got into .,m,1
"This movie is a classic - the perfect combination of action adventure , intrigue , and romance . It 's amazing .",f,1
This addition of the famous story is mostly to be recommended . The acting is first rate and 'Mercedes ' is a knock out . The movie works very well even though it does n't follow strictly to the book . My only criticism is it 's scanty treatment of the part of the story where Dantes The Count rescues his old employer and friend from ruin by setting him up with a new replica of his original one boat . This is one of the central parts of the story and deserved more screen time than it got .,m,1
"I really appreciated this film on the second viewing . Afterwards , I thought , `` Wow , that was really a satisfying , great film to watch . `` Satisfying , of course , to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale enacted out but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through . Boy , I hope this comes out on Blu-Ray some day . Acting-wise , the most fun to watch was Richard Harris as `` Priest , `` the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel , the man Edmond Dantes unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie . Harris had some of the best lines in the movie , several very profound statements . Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in `` The Passion Of The Christ '' - sermons about believing in God ! That 's the acting profession ; one film you play an atheist , the next you are Jesus ! For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow , stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison . Shortly afterward , he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch , played by Luis Gusman , who still sounds like he 's more at home in the streets of New York but , once again , you suspend belief and just go along for the ride . Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do , but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing , making enjoyable films like this . To be fair , it is n't just revenge , as this film points out , it 's `` justice '' we all like to see . In here , the two words are interchanged , depending upon one 's rationalizations .",m,1
"One of the best Movies I have seen in many years . Jim Caviezal will become a national treasure . Up there with Morgan Freeman , Hoffman , Redford etc . If you want to see a great movie and one to add to a collection this is it . Briancleveland ohio .",m,1
"This is one of my favorite versions of the count of Monte-Cristo ! I just love James Caviezel as Edmund Dantes ; he is a beautiful , handsome man ! If you love hidden treasure , pirates and seaman , and adventure , and romance , then this movie is just for you ! I highly recommend this movie , it is a story about a poor , innocent and handsome seaman , who gets charged with a crime that he did not commit ! His rich best friend Mondego , betrays Edmund , with the help of Dangler the ships first mate they are very jealous of Edmund . Villefort , a powerful and deceitful man joins forces with Mondego , and puts Edmund in prison , and charges Edmund with crimes that he did not commit ! Mondego ends up marrying Edmunds sweetheart Mercedes , while Edmund is in prison . After several years in prison , Edmund becomes bitter and seeks revenge , and with the help of a fellow prisoner Richard Harris-the priest , Edmund learns how to read and gets a education and learns how to sword fight ! The priest helps Edmund escape , and gives him a hidden treasure . Then Edmund is rich and free ! And seeks revenge ! I just loved this movie , a definite must see movie !",f,1
"This Buena Vista film version spoken in English of the Count of Monte Cristo is a very fast-paced DVD version of Alexander Dumas 's novel of the same title . James Caviezel and Guy Pearce 's performes are both well-performed . I could imagine James Caviezel as the Count of Monte Cristo as pictured in Dumas 's novel . The remainder of the characters also fitted their roles well , especially Danglars , Villefort , and Mondego . It is true that this film version is meant to display acting , especially plot sequence . It therefore does not allow the characters time to develop the way that Dumas 's book did . However , this film does present most of the major aspects of the book that are most important to remember . The revenge sequence at the end of the film does GREATLY variate from the book . For example , Villefort is arrested , Danglars is also arrested , and Mondego dies in a duel . This is not exactly what a BBC drama afficianado might want to see , but then again , no one has ever accused Buena Vista of attempting to mimic the BBC . Overall , if you want to watch the book on DVD , I would advise you NOT to purchase this DVD . However , if you are willing to watch a film that is relatively entertaining , with good acting and well-designed sets yet not altogether loyal to Dumas , than this might be the film version for you . Otherwise , the Koch Lorber Films French version of the Count of Monte Cristo 1999 , starring Gerard Depardieu might serve your purpose better - especially if you know how to converse well in Francais French .",m,1
"This is one of my favorite movies . Granted it was only released four years ago and I 've probably seen it 4-5 times . I find , not necessarily in this order , a strong sense of fidelity to the original book . While this may seem faint praise , when you compare it to the disasters of Musketeers and Iron Mask , this film is brilliant . The movie addresses the intrigue of the time . The Bonapartists , the Republicans , and of course the Star Chamber proceedings absent witnesses and certainly absent justice . Edmund Dantes is imprisoned not for something he did but for something he knows . And the prosecuutor who sentences him conspires with Dantes ' friend to arrange a Hitchcockian 'man on the train ' exchange of murder most foul , Villafort sentencing the unknowing Dantes to life or death in Chateau d'Iff , a watery prison-grave and Mondego , lusting after Dantes ' bethrothed , Mercedes , to murder his Villafort 's father , an embarrassing Bonapartist . The movie reeks of post revolutionary Paris and you get a palpable sense of the times . Dangerous times , but times when a man of revenge and money might make his way . We feel for Dantes once he escapes from prison , on the one hand rooting for his victory while on the other , saddened by his consumption of hate . Even Mercedes asks him to relinquish his hate and he tells her , surrounded by wealth , 'it 's all I have . 'Caviezel is brilliant as the brooding wronged man , articulate and well trained by his colleague in prison , Father Faria Richard Harris , with his rage and torture so very close to the surface . Guy Pearce is excellent as the promiscuous , unscrupulous Mondego , and kudos must be given to Luis Guzman , who is always good , and Harris , who is always brilliant . You ca n't miss . 5 stars .

Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo . I look forward to seeing this movie again .,f,1
"I must confess that I have not read the book that this movie is based on . I did enjoy the few Dumas stories I have read , though . Most people that give this movie a big thumbs down have read the book and , rather unrealistically , expect a perfect translation of a 900+ page book into a film with a run time of just over 2 hours . Obviously , that 's not going to happen . So I 'll just tackle the film itself . < p > The Count of Monte Cristo hit the theaters in early 2002 , arriving with all the fanfare of . . . well , you know when the grocery store gets a new shipment of cereal ? Less than that . But sometimes the smallest splashes result in the greatest impacts . The Count of Monte Cristo came out and reminded the few who saw it that a movie can have a great , cohesive story with superior acting and entertain without being either pretentiously arty or exceptionally lowbrow . As I said , all of the actors are great : Jim Caviezel , Guy Pearce , Richard Harris , Tom Everett Scott , Luis Guzman , Michael Wincott , etc . < p > If you 're looking for an accurate adaptation of the novel , this probably is n't your place , but if you 're looking for an entertaining , epic film with action , intrigue , betrayal , revenge , and even a dash of comedy , you ca n't do much better than The Count .",m,1
"This is a wonderful retelling of Dumas ' Count of Monte Cristo . James Caviezel plays a wonderful Edmund Dantes , and a mysterious Count Of Monte Cristo .",f,1
"We 've seen many of these revenge movies and the COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a compilation of them all . Oh , and throw in a little of the illiterate and naive country bumpkin who becomes educated by the kindly older gentleman during an undeserved incarceration and we have a great film . This movie is reminiscent of Zorro , Pirates of the Caribbean and all the good swashbucklers that we have come to enjoy . James Caviezel does an outstanding job of playing Edmund Dantes , the honorable and kindly young man who is wrongfully accused of treason by his jealous best friend . Abb ' Faria the delightful Richard Harris , another prisoner befriends Dantes during the thirteen years he is imprisoned . This priest not only educates Dante , but also gives him a map to a great treasure . When Dantes escapes he finds the treasure and then begins his quest of retaliation against those who betrayed him . We all like vengeance movies where the 'bad guy ' gets theirs and MONTE CRISTO is one of the best ! The scenery , costumes and acting are all top notch and the little love story is also highly enjoyable .",f,1
"Great flick for a Saturday night during the winter . The camera work and filmaking were excellent , Italy and France never looked so good from the sea . The actors were good , the novel was represented fairly well , and this movie moves along at a good pace . The classic themes of revenge , adultery , deceipt , redemption , father vs . son , friend vs . friend , lover vs . lover , are all in this movie . While this movie will not win a ton of awards , compared to so much of the low quality movies out there today , this movie definitely receives a grade of & quot ; B & quot ; or higher . Worth seeing .",m,0
"This most recent adaptation of the famous novel is a little slow and meandering in the first third of the movie , but following the appearance of Richard Harris - like a mole rising from the ground - the pace quickly picks up and explodes as the lead protagonist wreaks vengeance on those who betrayed him earlier . The movie is not as effective as the 1978 version which starred Richard Chamberlain in the lead role , but what it does have in evidence is some truly interesting features . My favorite extra feature on this DVD is the documentary which recounts the adaptation of the story and why the screenwriter made the changes that he did . Well recommended .",m,1
"If you have read this classic tale by Alex Dumas , you wo n't be disappointed ! This is a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up until the very end ! It will exceed your expectations , I promise you ! Jim Caviezel makes a great Dantes and Pearce 's dialogue is truly amazing . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",m,1
"I wrote a review for this DVD , but it never got posted for some reason . I gave it one star because I was under the impression that this was going to be released in FULLSCREEN only . At least , that 's what was listed on this page . But now , I look on this page and it says WIDESCREEN format . YES ! PHEW ! Okay , now I WILL buy this movie , because it is an excellent one . And looking at the special features listed , the DVD itself looks promising . < p > I will most likely write another review once I get the DVD and am able to explore the special features . Just wanted to say how glad I am to find out that the whole FULLSCREEN situation was a terrible mix up . I just hope that THIS is n't another typo .",m,1
"`` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is a lavish adaptation of the 1845 Alexander Dumas novel . The film stars Jim Caviezel as Dantes , a sailor framed for treason by his supposed best friend , Fernand Guy Pearce . But why would anyone frame his best friend for treason ? Well , poverty stricken Dantes has something rich and powerful Fernand does not ; love . Fernand wants Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk ; Dantes true love , for himself . Thus , Fernand concocts an evil setup , framing Dantes for treason . Dantes is then imprisoned on the cruel island prison of Chateau D'lf for 13 years , where he transforms from a lighthearted sailor to a bitter and angry man . While at Chateau D'lf , he plots revenge against those who betrayed him . < p > Richard Harris also puts forth a quality performance as Abb & eacute ; Faria , another innocent prisoner . With the help of this strange old man , Dantes escapes the island and transforms himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo after following an old treasure map to a load of treasure on the island of Monte Cristo thus the `` Count of Monte Cristo . Becoming rich and powerful is the first step in Dantes revenge . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' is such an enjoyable film mainly because of the sweet satisfaction involved in watching Dantes execute his revenge on Fernand . Revenge is always an exciting thing to watch ! The audience is able to identify with Dantes and sympathize with him . You may even find yourself becoming as obsessed over exacting revenge as Dantes ! My point is ; you are really drawn into the story , more so that any film in recent memory . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' brings in some intriguing aspects of Dantes personality about midway through the film . When Dantes returns as The Count of Monte Cristo , he sees that he could have a perfect life if he wanted to . His love , Mercedes , still wants to be with him and he now has all the money he could ever need . Yet Dantes pushes it all away . He must complete his revenge . It has now become clear that Dantes has become obsessed and can no longer look at the world in a rational way . It 's really quite painful to see what Dantes has become . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' boasts an intelligent screenplay , lavish sets and costumes , breathtaking cinematography , superb action sequences , beautiful music , superb directing and stellar acting .",f,1
"Classics remain beloved for hundreds of years because they are wonderfully crafted and contain universal truths that still speak to us . The director and producer of this condescending adaptation of Dumas ' classic story must feel that the modern American audience does n't have the intelligence to appreciate great classic works . Oh , the basic story line is there -- man is wronged , man goes to prison , man escapes , man finds treasure , man seeks revenge . But that is where the homage to this great work ends and the often ridiculous changes are made . I know that it is cliche to say that the movie is not as good as the book . In this case , however , I ca n't believe they actually had the audacity to call the movie by the same name as the classic novel which it so minimally follows . One can excuse some adaptations of a novel when produced as a screenplay , but the changes made in this case lose all the beauty and terrible power of the original story . Instead of a wonderful slow burn with a lot of atmosphere as Dantes slowly and painstakingly weaves a web of revenge for the wrongs done to him , we have stupid devices like a flamboyant entry in a hot air balloon , complete with Cirque du Soleil acrobats twisting on the ropes . Instead of an intricate plan to destroy the personages who wronged him , we have swashbuckling sword fights every few scenes . Some major characters are missing completely such as Valentine some have been shamelessly changed and substituted Jacopo for Ali . The final plot device is totally contrived and NOT in the book -- we find out that Dantes has a son sired on Mercedes before he was arrested . I guess the screenwriters felt they had to put some sex in the story or no one would like it . I awaited this production eagerly ; having now seen it I feel disgusted and insulted . If you want to see an intelligent production of the Count of Monte Cristo , avoid this movie like the Black Death . It would be better to lock the DVD in the Chateau D'If . If you have n't read the book , you may enjoy it , since you wo n't be dissapointed by what is lacking . It does have good scenery and filming , although some of the acting is terrible Jacopo especially . To the director and producers : for shame . Nearly everything about this movie was wrong , wrong , wrong . Give the American audience some credit for pity 's sake . We can appreciate great works just as they are .",f,0
"This movie is excellent as a movie . As far as following the book not so . However let 's be honest : If this movie were to be faithful to the book , it would be 100 hours long ! There are over 200 characters in the book , and several sub-plots that are unable to be adapted to cinema accurately . If one is a purist , do n't watch movies based on books ! You will always be disapointed . The job of someone adapting a book for Cinema , is not necessarily to reproduce the book in exact detail which in most cases is impossible unless its a tv miniseries that can run all week . It is to reproduce the essence of the story , and find those things which will make for the best film . That 's tough when you are constrained to 2-3 hours of film . The Count of Monte Christo presents the essence of Dumas ' story , a man betrayed by his best friend , learning the skills to survive in prison from a priest , also unjustly imprisoned , and returns to exact his revenge , and in the process , he learns that revenge is not worth it . The acting , costume , music , cinematagraphy and sword play is second to none , and the movie is quite entertaining . The only problem I had was that they spend a lot of time building up God , and religion and morals , then present fornication and adultery in a positive light because Dantes and Mercedes `` Loved each other '' , which as a Christian I had a problem with . Maybe that does n't bother the non-religious viewer , but it presents a contradiction to me that is at best difficult to reconcile and at worst ruins the moral impact of the movie .",m,1
"I was blown away by the incredible adaptation of a familiar tale . Jim Caveziel was hauntingly sensitive , only to turn fearfully vengeful . His nemesis , and former best friend , Guy Pearce , hinted at a carefully concealed malice before indulging in a fearsome betrayal . Everything in this film works . The sword play in this Alexandre Dumas swashbuckler is awesome . The sets , the costumes , all combine to seduce the viewer . Furthermore , the DVD extras are excellent , both informative and entertaining . I can remember Richard Chamberlain 's Count from the 70 's , I believe , and I did not expect to ever see a better one . But I was wrong . This film is better . A definite must-see , which I somehow missed when it was released .",f,1
"After seeing `` The Lord of the Rings '' 4 times in the theater I saw a preview and thought I would go see this one . First let me say that this is a wonderful movie ! At first I thought it started out a little slow , but then after a little it sped up and was a 'ca n't take your eyes off the screen ' type of movie . However , I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was expecting more action-as in swordplaying . Well actually I was expecting another `` Mask of Zorro '' movie Antonio Banderas . That was the first movie that came to my head while waiting to see `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . But I suppose they wanted to make it for a variety of audiences instead of just for the action movie type of people . I think that they did a very good job . Like someone earlier said , this movie works on all levels . This movie is perfect for anyone . But seeing that I have never read the book I obviously do n't have an opinion on what it looks like to them . But for those of you who do n't know the plot line it is very unpredictable and exciting and worth seeing .",f,1
"While this maybe an entertainig movie for the ones who have not read the book , it is an abomination for those of us who cherish one of the world 's greatest classics . It is like Romeo and Juliette getting married and live happily ever after . There are indeed beautiful scenes , good acting and an appealing story the movie is not really reflecting the book . I was thoroughly disgusted walking out of the theater . I would very highly recommend the 1974 version with Richard Chaimberlain as a much better film",m,0
"The Count of Monte Cristo is probably one of my favorite books . Its numerous , but inter-connected plot lines are filled with suspense , romance , and `` you know you had it coming '' revenge . The movie adaptation of this novel was awful . Except for the title , character names , and a few other details , there is nothing in the movie that resembles the original . The movie only focuses on the struggle and revenge of Edmound Dantes , which turns out to be a watered down version of the book 's . No amount of fight scenes would have saved this movie . Plus , the ending is completely different ! ! ! ! I would only recommend this movie if you plan to NEVER read the book . If you have read The Count of Monte Cristo , DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE ! It will only disappoint you . Like it did me .",f,0
"I have used the DVD & quot ; The Counte Of Monte Cristo & quot ; in religion class to give the teenage students a deeper understanding about 'Sins ' and 'Virtues ' . The character of Fernand Mondego is an example of a sinful man who is filled with : pride , envy , gluttony , lust , anger , greed and sloth . On the 'virtuous ' side is the character 'Edmond Dantes ' he displays the virtues of : humility , kindness , abstinence , chastity , patience , liberality and diligence . The movie poses some great topics for the students to dialogue over and they are excited to discuss it in class . I would however , show this movie in short segments of 30 minutes . There is plenty of material to keep your class in discussions for several weeks .",f,1
"I love , love , love this movie ! The acting is superb , especially the relationship between Edmond and the priest . This movie has it all - romance , friendship , family , betrayal , murder , prison , escape , love , poverty , wealth , etc . I 've watched this at least 20 times and will watch it again someday soon .",m,1
"I 'll start off by saying that the book is one of my all-time favorites and is well worth the read . But do n't expect the movie to exactly copy the book . The book contains far too much detail and plot turns to allow it all into a movie that could be viewed in one sitting , so why even bother to try ? The movie starts with the same premise as the book , it veers off into a new and refreshing direction . While it retains the same flavor , it differs in many of the details . The result is a wonderful story , optimized for the screen , that keeps those who know the story well very entertained and not quite sure what 's coming next . Jim Caviezel 's performance in this movie is excellence in acting . He displays the misery and agony well when needed , then moves onto a focused , calculated and emotionally-repressed Count . Excellent acting in one of the most difficult roles imaginable - right up his alley . Luis Guzman 's Jacapo makes the movie . The role of the character in the movie does an excellent job of helping to `` explain '' the Count efficiently . Nearly each line that comes from Guzman 's mouth is memorable - the quality of his performance alone would have overwhelmed many lesser movies . The action , effects , score and other items that you 'd expect from Hollywood are all there - in sufficient quantity without overwhelming the viewer . It definitely should have swept the awards in 2002 ! !",m,1
This is a beautifully done rendition of theclassic . This screen adaptation is better I think than the novel . The screen version has a more cohesive plot and it has a happier ending . It is a great family movie despite the sword fights and other intense scenes of violence . There is a lot of humor and romance but there are serious lessons taught as well without being preachy . My children range from age 10 to 17 and they all love it and quote from it all the time . This recent purchase was a gift . We have gifted several copies . It is one of our favorite movies .,f,1

"The original story by Dumas is a timeless classic . For me this film is not a great adaptation . Much of the film occurs in `` Dark-o-Vision '' . . . using only natural light or candlelight . Perhaps more realistic , but frustrating for lack of details to savor , and confusion during several action sequences . There are several outdoor scenes that have radical changes in lighting . The end duel occurs in bright sunny daylight and dark cloudy weather , all in a matter of minutes . The lead character just does n't seem to have the from the gut passion he should have . Actually the leads are just quick sketches , and not allowed enough time to become more than just puppets . I think too much precious screen time in spent in the set-up . This time should have been better spent in the social educational fighting re-awakening prison training sceens , especially when you have such an interesting and fascinating actor such as Richard Harris as the instructor . The delicious machinations of revenge , and the crushing realisation when the original betrayers are destroyed are not here , to be enjoyed by us or the protagonist . When he finally during his escape `` gets even '' with the whip wielding warden it is confusing and not satisfying for us the audience . Yes , revenge is wrong , and that message is reached at the conclusion . . . but it is a major audience pleaser , `` the money shot '' and should n't be glossed over , nor ultimately condoned . The swordfights were well choreographed , but filmed in a confusing manner , and without pace . For me the only part that reached wonder was when the Count first appears , in the balloon . But even that scene is quickly ended on a flat note . This is where the storey should start to reach an exiting level , allowing us and him to revel in his new rich and glamorous lifestyle , but always with the anger simmering underneath . There is some great location photography . Wonderful costumes . Good effort , but does not do the Dumas story justice . This is just my opinion , and does not mean any more or less than any one else 's .",m,0
The movie came in quicker than I expected and I am very pleased with the results,m,1
"Best movies I have purchased . . . . betrayal , deception and the power of love . . . . wow worth the cost ***********",m,1

"Whether you like this film or not will depend heavily on whether you have read the book and whether you believe that films based on books should follow the original text as closely as possible for example , Lord of the Rings . In this particular case , the film varies greatly from the book in both detail and tone . The overriding theme in the Dumas book is one of redemption and forgiveness ; the theme of the film is primarily one of revenge . As a result , major details in the book who is Albert 's father ? Who is Mercedes ' husband at the end of the story ? are changed to keep the narrative more focused on the theme of the film . However , if you are willing to look at the film as a work independent of the original text , you will find an excellent piece of cinema . Although changed from the dense Dumas novel , the story is compelling and well-written . The overall tone of the film is dark , though enough bits of comic relief are woven in to keep the story from being overly depressing , especially early on . Even in places where the film is basically consistent with the novel , the writers have made smart choices , for example by showing the action on Elba instead of having it all be retold in conversations as in the book . The cast is uniformly superb , including on of Richard Harris ' last films as the Priest and Jim Caviezal playing yet another Christ-character in Edmond . Guy Pearce , who was evidently offered Edmond but decided he would rather play the villian , plays Count Mondego with an ever-so-slight bit of guilt , though this does not affect the crowd-pleasing ending of the film . My favorate performance , however , is J . B . Blanc as smuggler Luigi Vampa . Blanc shows the kind of raw charisma that you would expect if Will Smith had played the role instead . The DVD has several special features , not of which are spectacular . The director commentary is above average and will provide you with some interesting additional tidbits about why the film was shot as it was . Or where it was , for that matter , such as the pieces shot at the Presidential Palace in Malta . That said , I am still trying to find the airplane that the commentary says is visible during the climactic fight scene . Overall the film is visually interesting and should be seen on as big a screen as you can get ; the camera 's scope in capturing the harbor at Marsailles or Edmond 's voyage to the Island of Monte Cristo is fantastic and will make this worthty of a big screen . At the same time , the scenes inside the prison are shot in almost all grays and gives a cramped and depressing feel to the life Edmond lives there . By the time he escapes you may not realize that you essentially have not seen color in 30 minutes . Overall this is an excellent film despite the departures from the book . if you come into the film with an open mind you will enjoy one of the more under-rated films to come out in the last 10 years .",m,1
"This 2002 film brings the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas to the screen with a swashbuckling intensity that starts at the beginning and never lets up . It 's set in France at the beginning of the 19th Century and tells the tale of a young man , falsely imprisoned because of his friend 's betrayal , who escapes and eventually has his revenge . Of course it 's more complicated than that . There are ups and downs and twists of fate . There is swordplay and hidden treasures and pirates and secrets unfolded . And it 's all wrapped up in a package that swept me up in the story and held me captive till the end . < p > Jim Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes who has the misfortune to have Fernand Mondego , played by Guy Pearce , as a friend . When Dantes is betrayed , he is sentenced to an unlimited amount of time in a terrible prison where he lives in solitary confinement and gets whipped once a year . The years pass , his clothes grow ragged , his hair grows longer and his despondency increases . Then , one day , another prisoner , Abbe Faria , played by Richard Harris , tunnels his way into Dantes ' room . Abbe Faria is old , but he has hope . And together they plan their escape . All they have to do is spend the next eight years digging another tunnel . In the meantime , Faria teaches his young prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; to read and write . He also teaches him to use a sword . Eventually , as they make their escape , the old man dies , but not before he gives Dantes a map to hidden treasure . < p > The story now takes a different turn because the treasure that is found allows Dantes to become The Count of Monte Cristo , return to his home town and exact revenge on Fernand Mondego , who is now married to Mercedes , played by Dagmara Dominczyk , who was once Dantes ' sweetheart . < p > The acting was excellent , the cinematography outstanding and the story wonderful . And , because I saw it on DVD , the extras made the experience of watching this film even better . There 's a short history of Alexandre Dumas , who was of Caribbean heritage and one of the most prolific authors of his time . There 's a interview with the screenwriter who talked about the difficulty of adapting this classic and explained exactly why he made certain changes in the story . There 's a section that shows the actors learning the art of fencing . And a section that shows how the sets were built . These extras were like icing on a cake and certainly enhanced the experience of the film . < p > I loved it . And highly recommend it . Especially the DVD version .",f,1
"Sadly to say , this film is a barebone , cheesy adaption of Duma 's original epic . The original novel was excellent , it had taken the Count of Cristo decades to plot and carry out his revenge bit by bit . It was sweet revenge at its ultimate ; his enemies were slowly tourmented in a cat & mouse sort of game . However in this movie , events fly by so fast that the entire story seems to happen over night . Most key characters were either deleted or under developed , and large chucks of the main story lines were cutted . These two reasons had made the Count 's revenge very unsatisfying , as such it 's my opinion that they had ruined a great story .",m,0
"The '02 release of `The Count of Monte Cristo ' boasts a superb cast and lavish settings in an outstanding retelling of this classic story of romance and revenge . James Caviezel is perfect as the outwardly stately and poised Count . However his appearance is but a mask to disguise the torment of a man imprisoned and beaten for 13 years . His only desire now is for revenge against his once best friend Fernand Mondego Guy Pearce who betrayed him and stole his love , the enchanting Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk . A classic tale that can be enjoyed again and again !",m,1
"If you have read Dumas ' The Count of Monte Cristo then you know that it is a tale that begins but developing the character of Edmond Dantes . He is a simple man whose main ambition is to marry the beautiful Mercedes . He proposes to her and on the night of their engagement he is arrested for treason , betrayed by his best friend . This is a summation of the first chapter . The second and maybe third chapter relates his time in prison , learning and growing from his relationship with a fellow prisoner . He also learns from this prisoner the location of a treasure suitable for a dozen kings . The remaining 90 % of the book relates the immensley complicated details of his revenge on those that tore from him the life he held so precious . It is a tale of intrigue and revenge that takes its time to build and develop . When you see the traps swinging closed on Dante 's enemies you feel a sense of accomplishment with him . Now , on to the movie . The first full half of the movie relates Dante 's betrayal and captivity . This leaves only an hour to illustrate his revenge . What is accomplished is a sad imitation of Alexandre Dumas ' master work . This is one of my favorite books , and one of my least favorite movies . Hollywood 's need for adventure movies to be fast paced to match today 's lifestyle has ruined this story for many people . They just do n't know it .",m,0
"Calling this movie after Alexandre Dumas ' original novel is like calling Bernstein 's 'West Side Story ' 'Romeo and Julliette ' after Shakespeare 's work . So many elements of the story were altered that Dumas ' original plot and theme are no longer recognizable except for the names of some of the characters . They might as well call this film 'The Count of Hollywood ' and set the story in modern L . A . instead of 19th century France . In this film , Dantes is informed of the mission to rescue Napoleon from the onset as opposed to finding about it when returning to shore . Danglars is barely in the picture and is cast as a pirate instead of a banker . Mercedes marries Fernand one month after Dantes is imprisoned instead of 18 months So much for her loyalty : why would Dantes even forgive her in the end if she were such a tramp ? Luigi Vampa is depicted as the captain who brings Dantes to the island of Monte Cristo right after his escape instead of being a murdering Italian kidnapper he meets much much later . Dante 's Turkish guards are ommitted from the story : there 's no Princess Haydee or Ali . There 's also no Caderousse . In short , this movie has really little if anything to do with Alexandre Dumas ' classic 'Le Comte de Monte Cristo . If that 's the story you want to see on film , do n't see this film . I strongly recommend the French 1998 mini-series instead of this farce : although Gerard DePardieu 's dinstinctive physique undermines his role as a master of disguise , his performance of the role is otherwise excellent . The mini-series is much more faithful to the characters , plots , and themes Dumas sought to convey in his literary masterpiece .",m,0
"I ca n't belive they dis such a horrible work on this movie , if they would have stuck to the plot that went on in THE BOOK , you know , where they got the idea from , then the movie would have been a success . But since hollywood likes to ruin great works of art , then they do what they did with this movie , they BLEW IT ! ! ! ! If you really want to get the true feel of The Count Of Monte Cristo , then READ THE BOOK , YOU WO N'T BE DISSAPOINTED THERE .",m,0
"Apparently someone who read the book 5 years ago gave the screenwriter a brief rundown on the plot . Holy [ cow ] . I really enjoyed the book and this was a big letdown . Huge parts of movie are new , and enormous pieces of the original plot are left out . It would be one thing if the changes made the transition to film easier , as with Lord of the Rings , but I do n't think they even tried . Dumas is not exactly the most daring or controversial writer ; I 'm not sure why a perfectly good story , and ending , had to be filled up with enough dairy to rival a cheese castle . If you have n't read the book in a while or at all and you do like this movie , or even if you think it was allright , please take the time to read or review the book . Maybe the makers did n't want to spoil the book for that have n't read it , I 'm not sure . There 's much more satisfaction at the end than an illegitimate child and a duel between two people that were never `` boyhood friends . ``",m,0
"I was partway through the rantings of another reviewer about how much this movie strayed from a classic . And how bad this adaptation was . But you know what ? I do n't really care . I have n't read the book , and I likely wo n't . I happen to like the film . It has a decent plot , good actors and a theme someone simple-minded as myself can understand - `` revenge '' . How often have we felt cheated in our lives ? How often have we felt that we are the underdogs ? This film shows us that good things will come to those who wait . That revenge is sweetest when it is well thought out and exacted with a fury . < p > In this story a sailer by the name of Edmond Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned when his best friend Fernand betrays him in order to steal his wife . In prison , Edmond is about to lose hope when a fellow inmate teaches him how to read write fight and escape from prison . At his dying breath , he tells Edmond of a buried treasure that he should use to do good . Edmond , however , has other thoughts in his mind . Edmond transforms himself into the mysterious and wealthy Count of Monte Cristo . With systematic planning , he cleverly inserts himself into high society and exacts revenge from his enemies of the past . His goal is not to kill them , but to humiliate them and let them know what it feels like to have nothing left to live for . < p > . . . The movie was fun to watch , so watch it .",m,1
"Very inferior to the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version . It 's as if a chimp took a sledgehammer to the story and knocked all the sense out of it . The characters are dumbed down and the actors are forced into flat caricatures except for a fine performance by Richard Harris . Caviezal is unable to transform the guileless young Dantes into the dynamic Machiavellian . When he makes his entrance as The Count of Monte Cristo , he limply floats onto the scene and sighs , `` Glad you could all make it to my party . `` Since most of the movie was shot in the dark , there is little for the eyes here . Even the music disappoints .",m,0
"This story is based on the classic Alexander Dumas book . The story is about friendship , jealousy , betrayal and then the best part the ultimate revenge and then love rediscovered . I believe this book has been adapted to the silver screen several times but I have only seen the version where Richard Chamberlain plays the count and despite Chamberlain 's obvious acting limitations I much preferred that version to this updated one . The main reason for this is that the way the revenge comes together in that movie seemed to be more cunning , complicated and satisfying . < p > The story is based around two friends who have sailed the world together . One grows jealous of the other as even though he Guy Pearce is a member of the aristocracy ; the other Jim Caviezel is more popular respected and also has a love-life . The Pearce character plots a dastardly plan removing Caviezel from France and sending away to a life term in prison where he may just as well be dead . The prison scenes are quite awful with some pretty dire dialogue and lines coming from the prison warden and are only made interesting by the brief appearance of fellow prisoner Richard Harris . Harris tells Caviezel of the vast riches to be found on the Italian island of Monte Cristo . Caviezel who was quite a loving character has now understandably changed and is obsessed with getting revenge on the three characters who placed him in this predicament . This aspect of the film I found very dissappointing-in fact some of the scenes are very poorly done . The counts reappearance to public life is way over the top and looks more like a scene from Moulin Rouge . The revenge on the attorney which takes place in a steam room is utterly absurd . By the time he reveals himself I found I really did n't care less anymore and was quite looking forward to the closing credits ! < p > I had anticipated having scene the trailer that this would be a lavish period drama with no expense spared . This movie at times is quite the opposite-the scene set in Rome is a terrible recreation and in facts looks like just a small studio setting . The scenes set in Marseille and the final scene could also be described as being pretty lame . Still though the fact that this is such a marvellous story saves the movie and would make it worth watching if you are unfamiliar with this classic novel .",m,0
"This is a very good movie but , the only thing it has in common with the book is the movie has some of the characters . There , that 's it . The movie could have been named anything but , not `` The Count of Monte Cristo . `` If you really want the whole story , read the book . It 's a great book . A good movie but , it has nothing to do with the book .",m,0
"This adaptation of Alexander Dumas 's THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO plays out more like a big budget A & E 'movie of the week ' than it does a major motion picture of swashbuckling adventure . < p > However , there 's a rousing and sweet joy in watching Edmund Dantes played with infrequent success at achieving one accent by Jim Caviezel carry out his plot to seek vengeance on those who stole his life away . Unjustly accused of treason , Dantes endures 16 years of solitude , most in prison , where he manages to meet a fellow prisoner Richard Harris and , together , they embark on an attempt to achieve their great escape . Guy Pearce L . A . CONFIDENTIAL , MEMENTO is put to wonderful use as the villain , and he proves he can chew scenery with the best of them . < p > Perhaps the only disappointment the film has is the lack of swordplay . In an interview , Caviezel stated that he took fencing lessons for six weeks even learning how to fence with both hands simultaneously , but there 's little swash to this buckle on the silver screen ; in fact , Caviezel only picks up a foil three times . The climax duel between the rivals is far too short for my tastes ; instead , I found myself enjoying the ride more than the destination .",m,1
The cast was good as was the the movie in general were it not for the fact that the story was so different from the actual book . It was a real dissappointment to say the least .,m,0
This is a great story of the Count of Monte Christo and how he became the count via the betrayal of a close friend and the tutoring of 'the prist ' in prison . Very inspiring movie I would recommend without any reservation .,m,1
"I had been searching for a blu-ray copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and had given up . Luckily , Amazon sends me messages when their DVDs are on sale . This last time , there it was ! Thanks , Amazon !",f,1
"This is an excellent movie . Even though it is & quot ; a typical Holly Wood production & quot ; , it did n't mutilate the plot so much you could n't even recognize the title of it . Edmond Dantes is protrayed perfectly but Mercedes ' actress does n't look like the real Mercedes . The film shows every thing that gets the theme of the book across , and the changes made fall into place . Even though I had my hands clutched in terror during parts of it , I still laughed and cried . It was a wonderful movie and the ending is so sweet . Even though the book 's ending was sweet , this one has the 'happily ever after ' part added to it . And all the subplots were eliminated , so were many characters so it is much easier to follow . And even though the film goes by so fast , the actions of the characters results in a lot of development .",f,1
"Edmond Dantes Jim Caviezel and his best friend Fernand Guy Pierce are forced to dock ship to save the life of their captain . Napolean will only offer medical assistance if Edmond delivers a letter from Napolean to Versaille . Little does Edmond know that it contains plans to overthrow the king . When Edmond and Fernand return , Edmond is promoted to captain of the ship and becomes engaged to his one true love Mercedes Dagmara Domincyzk . Fernand becomes jealous of Edmond 's life and he also feels betrayed when he manages to find out about the letter . He turns Edmond into the authorities . Now Edmond is branded a traitor to France and sentenced to life imprisonment in the worst prison imaginable . Mercedes is told by the crown prosecutor that Edmond is dead , and she marries Fernand . While inside , Edmond befriends a priest Richard Harris who educates him , teaches him to fight , and lets him know of a treasure of the Island of Monte Cristo . Edmond promises his friend that he will escape and find the treasure . Edmond finally does after 14 years and uses the treasure to become the Count of Monte Cristo . As the count , Edmond plans to gain revenge on Fernand and the Crown Prosecutor James Frain , as well as win back Mercedes . < p > Count of Monte Cristo has an amazing story of revenge and love , outstanding acting , and thrilling swashbuckling action that will keep you glued to the screen . Jim Caviezel nails the role of Edmond Dantes to perfection . Guy Pierce does an amazing job as Fernand . His treacherous ways make him the perfect villan . Dagmara Domincyzk does a nice job as Mercedes . I also enjoyed James Frain 's performance as the Crown Prosecutor . The best performance has to be by Richard Harris . Harris 's portrayal of the priest is excellent . The story itself will keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end and the fighting sequences are top notch . The only problem I had with the film , is that the adaptation did not really follow the book at all . However , the film still manages to be enjoyable , and in some instances , it is even better than the book . < p > The supberb acting , thrilling action sequences , and overall story are responsible for making Count of Monte Cristo one of my all time favorite films . The DVD offers outstanding picture and sound quality , as well as some nice special features as well . This is definately a film that I consider a must own .",m,1

"The book , The Count of Monte Cristo , is one of my favorites . I know that movies can miss certain elements in the book and that usually the book is better . So I can forgive most movies even if they miss some things . But this movie seems to have missed the point entirely . It seems that they thought sword fights and one-liners where what this story is about . Where the book created this fully fleshed world of Edmond Dantes , the movie is like the superficial Hollywood version of the hastily read cliff notes . If you are looking for a movie that takes the themes from this book accurately , then watch the movie , SLEEPERS . with Jason Patrick , Brad Pitt , Robert DeNiro , etc . Even though the time and place and people are entirely different , the story of this film rings more true to the heart of the novel , The Count of Monte Cristo , than any film version of the book I 've ever seen . Read the book , and watch both movies and you 'll see why .",f,0
"Dumas ' stories have been filmed so often , yet it still is a joy to see them . This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception . It has serious flaws and errors , too numerous to list . For example : modern language lines , totally unbelievable interpretations as other reviewers mentioned , very amateurish characterizations the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his nearly unchanged looks . None of these things really disgusted me . I just sat back and enjoyed . The opening scene set a mood and the photography generally showed fine settings . The very end was incredibly sappy , but since I had just watched a wonderful fighting fencing scene with a lush green setting , I did n't care too much . A strong complaint I have about most new movies : the voices are almost inaudible compared to the background music and noises . I hope you will read the book , if you have n't already . No film ever has done Dumas ' story telling power justice . The Three Musketeers film version with Michael York as d'Artagnan came close . If you 're willing just to be entertained , this movie may fit your mood . I saw it three times by now .",f,1
"This movie is a wonderful work of art . It should have won an Oscar ! The movie is set in France with lush backgrounds and a truly incredible story based on the book by Alexander Dumas . Not only is it a terrific tale of love and survival , it is also a feast for the adventure fan . The Count of Monte Cristo is filled with enough swordfights , daring escapes , and backstabbing comrades to satisfy any viewer . I highly recommend this movie .",m,1
"What an unmitigated piece of garbage . Richard Harris is always wonderful but he 's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas ' classic . See the G & eacute ; rard Depardieu mini-series instead . If you can ignore the fact that he does n't look starved in the Chateau d'If , it 's wonderful . Except for Harris the acting is poor . The people are unrealistic and are , at best , caricatures of Dumas ' creations . The writer has committed a crime .",m,0
"Well , there 's one thing that 's hard to go wrong with and that 's a classic story . It 's hard to fault the plot , when it 's based on a renowned classic like Dumas ' The Count Of Monte Cristo , even if it is a simple revenge tale . Unfortunately , none of the acting rises above the page . < p > None of the leading men are quite manly . James Caviezel who plays Edmond Dantes and Guy Pearce , who plays Fernand Mondego both come across a little weak as swashbucklers . Caviezel tends to be a blank slate anyway , but I really liked Pearce in Memento , so I was a little disappointed to see his be such a weak character . You do dislike Fernand Mondego and want to see him meet his demise , but Pearce could have taken it much further and given Caviezel more distance to grow as a character . Richard Harris may have walked through this role , but he delivers the best performance of all the actors . < p > Overall , it 's a good Saturday movie if you want to watch some guys sword fight a little bit and not have to think to much .",m,0
I have a blu-ray player that is a year old . The firmware is from this year . This is the first blu-ray disc that will not play . I tried two copies that were in perfect condition . Do not buy this disk .,m,0
"I ordered this dvd , it came in the mail quickly , it is in perfect condition no scratches . We have watched it 3 times already !",f,1
This movie is the events of Dumas ' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure love story . The formula is the same used in 80 's montage movies : 1 Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men . 2 Kid has a montage . 3 Kid gets revenge .,m,0
"This is easily one of the five worst movies I 've ever seen . Forget that , it 's one of the *two* worst movies I 've ever seen . While Guy Pearce is usually an excellent actor , and Jim Caviezel has the perfect look for Edmund Dantes at least , post-imprisonment , there is nothing that could have saved such a woefully terrible screenplay . The Dumas novel is one of the best books I 've ever read , filled with intrigue , action , and mystery , with vibrant characters and brilliant plotting . Granted , adapting such a grand story to the screen would probably take four hours or more , but if one is n't going to attempt an adaptation of the original story , then one should just make a new movie . That being said , all the interesting , original parts of the book were removed and replaced with a cookie-cutter revenge plot , stereotypical , one-dimensional characters , and bland dialogue that too often inserts modern slang into Napoleonic-era France . This movie is the `` Count of Monte Cristo '' in name only , and in every other way , a poorly conceived , vapid , dime-a-dozen action flick . Avoid it at all costs .",m,0
"My only reason for seeing this film is because Luis Guzman is in it . I find these Napoleon Shakespeare pirate films to very very dull , boring and over-long . Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing . Does n't he look handsome in that red English coat ?",m,0
"As a movie the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining on its own but when compared to the book it is horrible . There are several instances where Hollywood had its way with the plot . The revelation about who Alberts real father is being the worst . This did not happen in the book . The movie lacks the style of the book . The Count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never stooped to getting is hands diry himself . I also do n't recall any sword fights in the book although they were decent , but nothing spectacular . As I said , taken on its own the movie is entertaining but it deviates terribly from the book which is superior in everyway .",m,0
"Back in 1800 's , French writer Alexandre Dumas is famously known for writing `` The Three Musketeers '' but he is also known for writing the literary classic `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . The film would receive a TV film adaptation in 1975 starring Richard Chamberlain and an excellent TV series with Gerard Depardieu from 1999 but it was n't until 2002 when the novel would receive a film adaptation directed by Kevin Reynolds `` Waterworld '' , `` Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves '' , `` Red Dawn '' and written by Jay Wolpert `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' films . The film was well received by critics and has developed a fan following since its release on DVD . VIDEO : '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' is presented in 1080p HD 1:85:1 and having owned the previous DVD release of this film , I have to say that this film looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray . From the lavish outfits to the amount of detail on the costumes , the detail of the prison and overall set and costume design , there is so much detail in the textures . Black levels were nice and deep and I did n't see any banding or compression artifacts in this release . If anything , if you are a big fan of this film , the Blu-ray release definitely looks a lot better than its DVD counterpart . AUDIO & SUBTITLES : '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' is presented in English 5 . 1 DTS-HD Master Audio , French 5 . 1 Dolby Digital & Spanish 2 . 0 Dolby Digital . The original DVD release of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' was mainly dialogue driven while the Blu-ray release remains the same . It 's a dialogue-driven film and is pretty much center and front-channel driven . There are some moments during the film where you can hear the ambiance such as chains in the prison , the clanging of the swords or the galloping of horses through the surround channels . But for the most part , it is a dialogue-driven film . Subtitles are in English SDH , Spanish and French . SPECIAL FEATURES : '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' comes with the following special features : Audio Commentary With Director Kevin Reynolds - Featuring in-depth commentary by director Kevin Reynolds talking about the film , the production including some of the challenges faced as well as glitches in the film . The Pen - 6:38 A featurette about Alexandre Dumas , the original writer of the novel `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . A Retrospective on author Alexandre Dumas `` Adapting A Classic '' - 8:50 A featurette about the film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas ' novel and the challenges that Jay Wolpert faced . The Napoleonic World - 8:14 A featurette on the production and costume design of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' and locations of where Kevin Reynolds had considered shooting and how Malta was the location that was perfect for the film . The Clash Of Steel - 10:21 A featurette about the stunt choreography of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . Deleted and Alternate Scenes - 22:16 Featuring a total of five deleted and alternate scenes with intro with Director Kevin Reynolds and the editor , Stephen Semel and commentary featuring the two discussing why certain scenes were cut out . En Garde : Multi-Angle Dailies - 3 : o2 Featuring the dailies of the final sword fight ala two-camera setups with commentary by Kevin Reynolds . Layer-By-Layer Sound Design - 4:45 An interactive sound design featurette which you can listen to the isolated audio using your audio button . JUDGMENT CALL : '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' is a revenge film that does n't fit the banality of modern bloodlust revengeful films . It 's a clever storyline of one man 's climb from being an officer turned prisoner who had nothing . Illiterate , lost all family and his the woman he loves and is meant to rot in prison . What kept him strong is his belief in God , but the longer he stayed in prison , his belief started to fade and eventually , while in prison , is able to educate himself and become a better man which helps lead to his goal for revenge . There are a lot of twists and turns in the story of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' and as adventurous and exciting the plot line is , especially since it 's an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas ' classic novel , director Kevin Reynolds knows that he is not making a true-to-novel adaptation . There is just no way to capture the setting and overall theme of the novel in a two hour movie . For those wanting a more faithful adaptation , the 1999 TV series featuring Gerard Depardieu is the most faithful adaptation of the novel yet . But for those who are not willing to engage in reading `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' , Reynolds direction and Wolper 's screenplay focuses on the more swashbuckling , adventurous side of `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . And since the making of this film , Wolper has not deviated from focusing on the action and adventure as evident in the `` Pirates of the Last Caribbean '' films that he has written thus far . The historic events revolving around Napoleon Bonaparte is not important in the overall film , it 's the revenge factor and seeing how a man that is sent to rot in prison would eventually find a way to exact justice on those who framed him . It 's also important to note that their is also a humorous side to the film . For one , the casting of Luis Guzman as Jacopo was quite amusing , but for the most part , it worked . Some acting was a bit off , especially when it comes to James Caviezel 's earlier Edmond Dantes but it does get better as the film progresses . The same can be said with Dagmara Dominczyk 's Mercedes Iguanada and found that I had to switch on the subtitles to understand what she was saying at times . But for the most part , I enjoyed `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' and the Blu-ray release looks much better and sounds better than its original DVD counterpart and all the special features that were included on the 2002 DVD release is included on this Blu-ray release . The film is pretty much it 's own story and really ca n't be compared to Alexandre Dumas ' novel . In fact , there may be some similarities by name , by location and such but if you are looking for a close adaptation to the novel , this film is not it . But for those who enjoy Jay Wolpert 's style of writing especially for what he has done for the `` Pirates of the Last Caribbean '' films , then you probably will enjoy this film . Overall , `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is exciting , entertaining and a clever revenge film worth watching !",m,1
"`` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is a classic tale of betrayal and revenge which the novel 's author , Alexander Dumas , was inspired to write after reading of an incident , broadly similar in its basic aspects , in an essay written by a French police archivist . The main character , Edmond Dant & egrave ; s , is betrayed and falsely accused of treason , subsequently immured in a bleak and cruel prison , where he makes a fortunate acquaintance in the Abb & eacute ; Faria , another wrongly accused prisoner , who eventually provides him with the education both social and martial and the financial means to exact revenge upon his accusers following his inevitable escape . Upon achieving his freedom , Dant & egrave ; s falls in with a crew of smugglers giving him the disreputable , underworld connections that will prove so useful to him later , recovers a literal buried treasure bequeathed him by the Abb & eacute ; Faria , and assumes the identity of an Italian nobleman , the titular Count of Monte Cristo , which opens the doors of aristocratic Parisian society , thus giving him access to his targets . He then plots and carries out the downfall of all his enemies . His revenge achieved , he then resumes his relationship with the beautiful woman to whom he was engaged prior to his arrest . In this last part , the movie departs completely from the novel , but I actually like this better ; not only did I always feel sorry for Dumas ' Merc & eacute ; d & egrave ; s , who lost everything , and went off to live out the remainder of a rather broken , lonely life , but the woman with whom Dant & egrave ; s eventually finds love , Hayd & eacute ; e , always seemed to me a rather pale , colorless character , who serves little purpose in the story , and seems to exist only to provide Dant & egrave ; s with a happy ending . This is a film which , if memory serves , did moderately well at the box office , but no more than that . For the life of me , I simply can not fathom why that is . Perhaps it 's because it did n't have enough `` action . `` If that is so , it 's a terrible commentary on how audiences ' expectations have been dumbed down , and whose attention spans have been shortened by a steady diet of simple-minded action movie blockbusters over the past several decades . Sure there is only one spectacular fight , but the film needs no more than this and such things were signally lacking in the novel as well , where Edmond Dant & egrave ; s achieve his revenge by plotting and intrigue , not by fisticuffs or swordplay . I do n't think the disappointment of ardent fans of the novel can explain why the film did n't enjoy better success , as I doubt that a majority of film goers these days have actually read all of it . And I might as well mention , at this point , the harshest criticism that usually gets leveled at this film : that it does n't do justice to the novel . Every time I hear someone say this it makes me shake my head in exasperation . The novel was over a thousand pages long , has a enormous cast of characters , several subplots unfolding beneath the main plot , and was originally serialized over the course of eighteen months during it 's initial publication , which gave its readers plenty of time to digest the many twists and turns of the novel , and the way many characters ' fates are interwoven and their stories overlap . In just what world to these critics imagine one can `` do justice '' to a story this long and this complex in the course of a two-hour feature film ? OF COURSE the movie makes radical alterations to the story , omits nearly all the subplots , and eliminates most of the supporting characters . There was no way to fit all that material in a feature length movie . Even the 1998 French miniseries starring G & eacute ; rard Depardieu could n't accomplish this . It would take at least a full season-long television series to do it in its entirety hmmm . . . now THERE 'S an idea ! . People should realize the movie is only based on and inspired by Dumas ' superb novel , and enjoy the movie for what it is : a truly great film . So having said all that , I 'll reiterate my wonder that this movie did n't do better at the box office . It has something in it to appeal to literally everyone . If you like adventure , look no further . If romance is your thing , it 's in there too . Exotic , gorgeously scenic locations ? Got 'em . In spades . Do you love period films ? They do n't come much better than this one . Do you like suspense ? It 's in there too . Really , the film 's got just about everything . The story is marvelous , the pacing is pitch-perfect , the villains are appropriately contemptible without being clich & eacute ; d or cartoonish , the cinematography is brilliant , the locations are a sumptuous feast for the eyes Malta stands in particularly well for early 19th-century Marseilles , the set and costume design is absolutely first-rate , and the acting is superb . This last point is worth emphasizing . Every actor turns in a great performance , and two in particular -- James Caviezel as Dant & egrave ; s , and the late Richard Harris as the Abb & eacute ; Faria -- are absolutely stellar . If you 've read and loved Dumas ' novel , and have n't seen this yet , do n't expect the original story to be faithfully reproduced on screen , and remember that it ca n't be in a two hour movie . Instead , think of this film as a similar story , based on similar characters , but meant to be enjoyed entirely on its own merits . Approach it on those terms , and you will be in for a positively wonderful cinematic experience .",m,1
"First of all , let 's get one thing out of the way . This film is an adaptation of a novel and as such it adds some new elements and deletes some others . Note to book-to-film critics : Get over it . A book and a film are two entirely different mediums and by definition one can not be precisely parallel to the other , even if based on the same material . It 's such a puerile , narrow-minded point of view to believe that a film has to mirror its source material with exact detail something that , in many ways , is a wholly impossible task . Screenwriter Jay Wolpert , in a feature on the DVD , is asked how he responds to charges that his script greatly deviates from the novel . His response is to smile and say `` Thank you ! It was n't my job to stay true to the book . My job was to make a movie , not film a book . If you want a dead-on version of the book - read the book . It 's a good book ! It 's just not a movie . `` The point is that , in the end , the only thing that matters is that an excellent film has been made . It 's with great pleasure , then , that I note that `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is an outstanding adventure film that harkens back to a lost era . For starters , the film has a killer cast . Jim Caviezel makes for a pitch perfect Edmond Dantes . He adroitly conveys youthful , naive innocence at the beginning of the film and performs in an equally believable fashion as the older , wiser version of Dantes . You can see it in the way he walks , he carries himself differently , and he speaks with an assured resolve . Dantes time in prison has ravaged him to the point where he 's left with only a single-minded determination to exact revenge at any cost . The transformation is sufficiently contrasted when Dantes first arrives back in Marseilles after his imprisionment . He 's a slender , bearded , drab looking sort of fellow . At that moment , the film flashes back to Dantes earlier in the film , as the wide-eyed youthful boy who no longer exists . Guy Pearce , with his capacity for displaying the most elite arrogance at all the best moments , masterfully portrays the character of Fernand Mondego . Pearce captures the essence of Mondego , who can appear at times as a properly slick nobleman , but who is in reality unbelievably petty and hopelessly envious of Dantes . The stunningly beautiful and undercast Dagmara Dominczyk creates a terrific interpretation of Mercedes , the fiance of Dantes and eventual wife of Mondego . In many ways , she undergoes as vital a transformation as Dantes during her unhappy marriage . She feels trapped and isolated to the extent that she is wearily resigned to her fate . It is n't until Dantes reappears that she realizes there is a way out , and watching her character come to life should bring a smile to nearly anyone . The great Richard Harris , cast as Abbe Faria , is able to firmly establish the complexity of his character even though he is only in the film for about a half hour , a remarkable feat to be certain . Harris is one of the highlights in the film , and even injects a bit of levity into the story . For instance , when Dantes initially scoffs at the idea of Faria 's idea of taking eight years to tunnel out of the prison , he responds `` Does something else demand your time ? Some pressing appointment , perhaps ? `` In his darker moments , such as when Faria is telling Dantes of his past misdeeds , it 's clear that Harris delves deep within his own recesses to deliver the regret in his lines . Just listen to the well of emotion he is able to tap into when he delivers lines such as `` I was ordered to burn down the church with them inside it . `` `` Did you ? `` , Dantes asks . `` To my everlasting shame I did . . . I did . `` Edward Shearmur provides an appropriately sweeping score , the type which remains in your mind long after the film has ended . As for the cinematography , it is extraordinarily gorgeous . Filmed primarily in Ireland and Malta , the feature takes great pains to capture the sights and sounds of the era . It 's astonishing the effort and detail put into the sets and seems so regrettable that , as Guy Pearce mentioned in a feature on the DVD , it was all simply torn down after filming . During the same feature , it details some of the production work such as the fact that the crew had the massive , imposing fountain in the carnivale scene custom made in England and shipped to Malta specially for that one scene . `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is a sprawling story with dozens of characters and a myriad of threads . Any film is faced with quite a tall order attempting to condense the novel into only two hours of screentime . This film makes this massive missive into a concise and accessible package , which will no doubt encourage audiences to revisit the novel and take in all the extra nuances there . All the highlights from the novel are presented while all of the excess baggage is jettisoned . Further , the additions to the story especially the revelation Albert 's parentage make for excellent cinematic moments . This film recalls the golden age of adventure films in that it is expertly paced , wonderfully filmed , and can be watched by audiences of any age . The DVD contains four major supplementary features including a superb making-of special titled `` An Epic Reborn '' . Spanning over thirty minutes , this feature covers the life of the author Alexandre Dumas , an interview with the screenwriter , a look into creating the Napoleonic world including some set design , and a segment with the swordfight choreographer detailing how he plans and executes the swashbuckling scenes . Also of note are four deleted scenes , one of which is actually an alternate version of a scene , and all included with non-optional commentary with the director and film editor . Rounding out the features is a split-screen scene showing the multi-camera angles used and one complete scene from the film with all the audio components on different tracks , allowing the user to switch between them . The only thing missing is a theatrical trailer , but with the advent of the internet this can be viewed any time one wishes anyway .",m,1
"Personally , I never read the book this story is based on so I think my look into the movie is on a movie itself scale which would be entirely different if you read the book . That said , the movie is fantastic in my opinion . As a viewer I was instantly pulled into the storyline and consistently brought to the edge of my seat moment after moment waiting for the next piece of action to occur . And I find it hard to believe but the moments when his revenge is enacted I felt a personal joy seeing Dante take it . The story itself , as mentioned by others as well , is about a man who is betrayed , locked away in a prison forever , forgotten , freed by a chance situation , given a great treasure , and with the means to do it given a chance to take revenge for being wronged . Yes , at times Dante is extravagant , as mentioned in other reviews , but I think the director was interweaving the current culture into the story to better adapt it to the audience so perhaps this was a necessary change . With our semi-materialistic world view where the bigger and flashier the more exciting it probably seemed like a good choice to keep us entertained . Yes , in the time of the book 's release this would have been seen as silly but it keeps audiences today interested which perhaps is more important . Anyhow , this movie is a solid , fun , exciting movie and while it 's not the sort you 'll see reviewed as a groundbreaking gem to add to your collection it 's definitely worth having if only to whip out from time to time . You 'll enjoy this one .",m,1
"I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline . Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book , the `` boy getting the girl '' in the end offers more satisfaction",m,1
"Director Reynolds fashions a handsome , sweeping , exciting epic that keeps his audience glued in place . Pearce 's Fernand is so despicably low , we can not wait for the long-suffering Edmond to wreak vengeance . In this hugely entertaining picture , revenge is a dish served hot , and adventure fans are sure to feel sated by the end . Also , solid family viewing- with older children .",m,1

"The Count of Monte Cristo is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end . Starring the handsome Jim Caviezel in the lead role of Edmond Dantes and the Count , the story takes you on a nonstop ride of adventure . Also starring Guy Pearce as his best friend turned enemy The Count Mondego . The Count of Monte Cristo will leave you breathless . Revenge is sweet for after being wrongly convicted of a crime , Edmond is sent to prison for 13 years , were he meets a compassionate priest played by Richard Harris . After the sudden death of the priest and the joyest escape , Edmond sets out on a journey of revenge . Slowly taking everything from his ex-best friend the Count Mondego , Edmond who is now the Count of Monte Cristo , hatches a plan to seek the ultimate revenge against the people who had plotted to ruin his life . With period costume designs by Tom Rand , and under the very capable direction of Kevin Reynolds , The Count of Monte Cristo is an adventure waiting to happen , with a few twists on the way .",f,1
"I was going to leave a review saying something like , `` Apart from the book , it 's a good movie - but poor Mr . Dumas ! If I were him , I 'd rise from the grave to haunt those filmmakers for what they did to my story . . . `` But then I saw all these excellent reviews here that had already addressed the subject and gave detailed explanations of how the movie was different from the book , what parts were changed the most , and whether those changes were justified . So I guess I will not repeat what has already been said so well ; instead , I 'll just tell you what I personally liked about the movie . < p > First of all I would like to say that whenever the movie mentions God , it is done in a very appropriate way , neither profane nor preachy . Another accomplishment that goes along the same line is the portrayal of Faria , who is a believer and at the same time a respectable figure . There have always been jerks among Christians , but there have always been admirable people as well . Sometimes moviemakers seem to forget that part . < p > Another reviewer mentioned that they appreciated not having to cover their kids ' eyes because there were no sexually explicit scenes in the movie . I agree ; there was one somewhat close , but it could have been so much worse since there is a love story involved . < p > Overall , it is a good movie . Love , friendship , betrayal , long suffering , fantastic escape , instant riches , revenge - everything you need for a great adventure , plus a deeper meaning to ponder .",f,1
"Going into the film I expected a good time , watching an okay movie and hanging with some pals . What I got was a good time , hanging with pals and watching an excellent movie ! The much-filmed story gets restyled with youthful actors and an interesting script , not to mention the intriguing story . The story I am speaking of is that of Edmond Dantes played with innocence and then anger by Jim Caviezel who seems to be riding the high life with a new job as captain and a beautiful fiancee until he is arrested for treason . What Edmond does n't know at first is that he has been set up by his jealous friend Ferdinand played with evil smarmyness by Guy Pearce . With such high caliber acting and beautiful settings , it 's tough not to be completely drawn into this story . I highly recommend that if you 're going to the theaters this weekend , that you check this one out .",f,1
"When I first saw this movie , I was surfing the limited channels on our television a week or so ahead of the time they would actually come on so that I could catch any that sounded promising . This was one of those . The description sounded good and a few of the actors ' names sounded familiar , although I had never seen any of their movies to date . So , last night when my sister and I had nothing to do , we decided to switch it on . And let me tell you . It was worth it . Though a little confusing at times , I found this movie highly enjoyable . It also made sense , which was good . There seemed to be a reason for everything . And , okay I 'll just say it . One of the main reasons this is such a good movie is because Jim Caviezel was the main character . Like I said , I had never seen any of his movies and I still have n't exept for this one , of course so , I was somewhat surprised to see how hot he was . I mean , yes , it did take some time for me to see the full extent of it , but when I did , I could n't stop talking and thinking about it . You would think that it was utterly impossible for a man to look hot in all the stages of his life , miserable as it was at times . I mean , he looked hot in every single scene . Especially as the Count . Basically this is a movie about revenge . Edmund Dontes is in love with this girl named Mercedees , but ca n't marry her because he is too poor to buy a ring . He is charged with high treason for delivering a letter for someone , and is sent to prison at a horrible place where he stays for 13 years . Meanwhile Mercedees and his best friend , who actually helped frame him , get married . Edmund escapes and finds all this treasure and gets really rich . He then decides to get revenge on everyone who wronged him . This is a pretty good movie . I would n't give it five stars though . Probably about 4 . 5 or something . But Jim Caviezel helps a bunch . He is a really good actor . I guess you wo n't know 'til you watch it .",f,1
"This movie provides one of the best film interpretations of Dumas ' book I 've seen . Although much of the plot is cut out , realistically this movie is a great adaptation of an amazing book . If you choose to see this movie , be sure to read the unabridged version of the book as well . Even if you 're not in it for the literature , this movie is an exciting watch regardless .",m,1
Because I read the Count of Monte Cristo in it 's entirety three times in high school I was disappointed with the liberties the director has taken in this cinematic version of the film . It starts out fine but about 1 5th of the way into the movie it begins to depart dramatically from the book . I guess if you have never read the book the movie might be ok but I was so hoping to see the whole story of the Count of Monte Cristo told in all it 's glory in the DVD . The story line is based loosely on the story as written by Alexandre Dumas but it departs in very significant ways from the book so much so that by the end it does n't resemble the book at all .,m,0
"Only an eternal optimist expects great things from a book-to-screen adaptation . This optimist expected at least good things from this 2002 version of Dumas ' classic tale of revenge , mostly due to the casting of Guy Pearce and James Caviezel . But just a few short minutes into the film , it becomes apparent that this was going to be the & quot ; Count of Monte Cristo & quot ; in name only . < p > In my view the power of the book rests in the character of Edmond Dantes later the Count . In the film version , Monte Cristo is depicted as a rich fool , unable to command respect and totally devoid of subtlety : witness the deus ex machina hot air balloon entrance of the Count onto the Paris scene . How absurd ! In Dumas ' exquisite story , Monte Cristo wielded an unquestionable power over all he came in contact with . Quite the opposite is true of Caviazel 's Cristo . But this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg . The movie lacks character development of even the few antagonists and protagonists it chose to include . As one reviewer noted , the book Monte Cristo was able turn his enemies into monkeys , while this film just makes a monkey of itself . < p > Taken as completely separate from the book , this is a decent film . The acting , costume and set design , and action sequences are very respectable . This is an average movie in and of itself . It becomes less than average strictly because of its association with a sublime work of French literature , which is resembles not .",m,0
"It wo n't trouble the Oscar voters , it wo n't stimulate intense discussion and debate , but by crikey , this adaptation of Dumas ' classic novel will make you forget about the drudgery of life for a couple of hours . < p > This , in my opinion , is Kevin Reynolds best film since Fandango . . . and it 's been some time ! He sticks to a formula of being fairly true to the book and keeping it simple - doing just enough to produce a piece of total entertainment . He is of course working with great source material , and yes , we all know the story , but it 's still great fun and thoroughly enjoyable . < p > Jim Caviezel is simply spot on as the hard-done-by-hero Edmund Dantes . As he showed in Angel Eyes , no-one does doe-eyed innocence like Jim , and he simply smoulders as the vengeful Count . He has the screen presence of a 1940s movie idol - tall , broad , quiet and dignified - and you thought they did n't make 'em like that anymore ! And , as he demonstrated in The Thin Red Line and Frequency , he is a fine actor . If they have any sense , producers will be queuing up to give him the sort of meaty roles that will guarantee him leading man status . < p > Guy Pearce has fun as the evil Count Mondego . Kudos to the hair-dressing department for creating a `` do '' worthy of Best Supporting Hair Piece status , but I think he thinks he is Alan Rickman in Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , but he just does n't quite cut it . < p > The leading lady is suitably beautiful and Richard Harris again turns in a scene-stealing supporting performance . < p > Yes , there are big old holes in the plot , but , if you 're willing to check your brain at the door and be entertained , then buy a big bucket of popcorn , put your feet up and enjoy every minute of action and every frame of fabulous scenery in this movie . Yes , it is fluff . . . but marvellously escapist fluff at that . In a time of such horror and violence in the world , a film like this is surprisingly welcome .",f,1
"About 2 3 through this film , the director , Danny Schecter , talks about the predatory and devestating effects of the `` subprime '' lending formula . As that has become an issue of late , you might see the film as a prophecy , and a sign the the bubble is , indeed , bursting . I feel compelled to point out that a few 1-star reviewers saw this DVD as an indictment of Bush . Those people either did n't see it or had such a pro-Bush bias that they did n't hear Schecter and those he interviewed repeatedly saying that it pervades both parties ! And another important reflection : the standard line when credit issues come up is something those of us allegedly on `` the left '' ignore , i . e . , individual responsibility . Did you really have to buy that flat screen TV ? I wo n't deny that , but nor will I deny that the very basis of our whole economic culture is CONSUMPTION . That stuff is shoved down our throats all the time . Indeed , if people would refrain from that sort of consumption , the US economy would fall apart in a week . So there are two sides to that as well . In fact , there is a portion of the film which describes stores in the `` low income neighborhoods of color '' in NYC which have `` rent to own '' shops where people will end up paying $ 750 for a television they could get for $ 195 at a mall . What 's more , it does n't do us much good to ignore individual responsibility , but why not acknowledge the responsibility of those pressing and making the loans -- off of which they 're making obscene profits -- too ! Or are they responsible for nothing ? The film begins with a Baptist congregation in Norfolk , VA where the congregation helps out members who 've gone bankrupt . They bail out that person and decry being in debt . The story continues in chapters , based on who 's going bankrupt including actress Lorraine Bracco of `` The Sopranos . `` What ? A movie star can go broke ? ? and why . It covers the predatory companies . Ironic , I just saw it ten minutes ago and am still processing the whole concept . I guess I relate to it as I 've been saying the same thing for a long time . When I went overseas as a professional 30 years ago , my boss did not qualify for a credit card so , needless to say , nor did I . I was in my 30s when I got my first credit card . When I moved to the area where I live now and got a job at the national HQ of an association , a colleague of mine joked that his high school son got junk mail for credit cards daily . That 's how `` easy '' it was is to get credit . The film too discusses with young people the debt they 've incurred because of such cards . One young woman had spent the last nine years paying off half her $ 16 , 000 in credit card bills , and felt it 'd take her as much to pay off the next half . In the meantime , there are credit companies galore giving credit cards to freshman at a Rochester , NY institution . And credit cards are n't the only culprits . The film went over tax deals , in which people are given loans at an outrageous rate as an advance on their tax return , the `` rent to own '' shops like I referred to above , again , the subprime loan rates , any number of means that the wealthy will make a lot of money off the shrinking middle class . Again , back to the `` nonpartisanship , `` there 's a portion of the film in which a conservative radio talk show host sponsors a seminar on cutting up credit cards . So it 's not a conservative bashing story at all . Toward the end of the film , you might say it ends with a `` metaphor . `` A helicopter with a number of executives of one of the larger credit predators in the US went down in the East River in NY . The executives were rescued , but one of those scholars being interviewed said that , while he would n't wish such a disaster on anyone , in effect , they may have `` had it coming '' more than anyone else . Then the film returns to the congregation in Norfolk because that 's the home of a large naval base . And even troops and sailors returning from Iraq are being victimized by the 26 or so shops that give the returning troops instant money so they do n't have to wait for their paychecks . But that money comes at a BIG price , still another dimension of the credit industry . Some are taking out one loan to pay off the last , time and time again ! Overall , I think it 's important that people , young and not so young , see this film . What I wish it had stressed more is that it 's not just consumption of the frivolous that puts many of us in debt . It 's also unforseen medical expenses and the type of bills we ca n't avoid that are also driving many of us into the foreclosures and bankruptcies which were the real subject of the film . I mean , that was covered , but needed to have been stressed more . Overall , though , Danny , thanks . We needed to see this .",m,1
"Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film ! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear . At some point , young adults will see how important maintaining good credit , mastering a budget and committing to saving will pay off -- for good or for bad .",f,1
"Keep up the good work Danny ! I hope you do another documentary on this ever expanding problem . Reward cards are something that need looking at more closely . Who is actually paying these `` rewards '' . It 's the merchant fees that we all pay for whether we use credit cards or not ! Fact is , many people ca n't use a reward card or simply do n't want to deal with greedy credit card co 's and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they do n't get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go , they take credit cards . And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices ! And these card co 's have it set up so the merchants ca n't give a lower price for cash customers ! It 's outrageous ! And I hope you do more about debt buyers . It 's insane these co 's can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest . Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed ! Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest ! It does n't make any sense to put someone in debt further . And last but not least , these predators who flood the mailboxes of the newly bankrupt should not be allowed to send them any mail for at least ten years . That is the amount of time bankruptcy remains on someones credit report . If the newly bankrupt want to get back in the credit card game , then let them find these cos . There should be a law that these co 's with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy . Unfortunatly , some will not understand these offers or will be desperate . They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like `` we want to help you re establish your credit '' or `` you deserve a second chance '' . Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again ! These co 's will even extend credit to people living below the poverty line ! !",f,1
"This is a very good documentary on the subject of credit card debt and predatory lending , but does n't pack the emotional punch of a similar documentary titled Maxed Out that came out roughly at the same time . The documentary shows as a society that the middle and lower classes are drowning in a sea of debt from payday loan places and credit card debt . It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern , but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information . It does however show you that debt is often not caused by stupidity or foolishness but by circumstances that could affect any one of us .",f,0
"This powerful program exposed the credit card industry and how with the political power of Congress trap the consumer into what the program produced called `` 21st century serfdom '' . This program was made before the 2008 economic melt-down and it was so true that the country is still on the rocky road despite the government declared recession was over two years ago , as the unemployed max out the 99 weeks of benefits . As recent as last week , the political leaders of both parties argued in Congress to raise the debt ceiling to borrow more while still accusing others of currency manipulation . Spend , spend , and spend out of a recession ? Will our kids , grand-kids , great grand-kids inherit this debt which may endanger our status , credit and national security ?",m,1
Sharply critical of our national and personal use of debt to finance lifestyles beyond our means and an indictment of the credit banking mortgage industry engaged in predatory lending and usurious interest rates . This film came out in 2006 ; it 's eerily prophetic of what happened to our economic house of cards in 2008 .,m,1
This is clearly a great flick that lets the viewer 'see ' how the banks view you the credit consumer . It really goes into accurate detail on how the finance industry is trying to snare consumers from and young age and create a generation of debt slaves . They also have a chilling prediction on where all this 'debt ' is heading . I highly recommend this flick .,m,1
I went on a debt reduction program on my own at 42 years old and now at 45 I am debt free . I recommend that you buy this DVD at any price . I also recommend that you do n't watch it alone . Let some others benefit from the knowledge of what debt has and is doing to our society . Even if they do n't do anything about it at least they will have the education of how the debt system works .,m,1

"I have been obsessed with Van Gogh , since I first laid eyes on his originals in L . A . . Prints of his work just do n't show the awe inspiring life force that emanates from his paintings . `` Through the Eyes of Van Gogh '' is a sensitive and intense work of art in itself . It achieves an externalization of Van Gogh 's internal struggles of trying to make a living , trying to relate to others , trying to hold on to his unique vision of art and his brave battle with mental illness , all of which he felt he failed at , at the time of his suicide . I feel this film brilliantly achieves looking through the eyes of Van Gogh , by focusing on his time in the mental hospital with the addition of flashbacks to pivotal points in his life . The writer , who is also the actor who portrays Vincent , has created a portrait of Van Gogh that is as palpable as his paintings .",f,1
"Who is Alexander Barnett ? He is the man who wrote , directed and stars in what is arguably the most poignant and profound portrayal of Vincent van Gogh ever put on film . There have been many movie Van Goghs : Kirk Douglas ' rendition in LUST FOR LIFE is magisterial . But despite the intense veracity of Vincente Minnelli 's 1956 film , there were warts beneath the warts in the actual history that just did n't make it to the screen in that lavish and rich outing . Robert Altman offered a grimmer and grimier version of things in VINCENT AND THEO and Tim Roth gave us a more insular artist - whereby from all historic accounts the destined Dutchman was extremely demonstrative and vocal and all over the place . Jacques Dutronc 's turn with the paint brush in VAN GOGH was likewise introspect in a biopic that flung facts around as wildly as Van Gogh flung paint anywhere and everywhere in his frenzied attack of the nihilistic blankness of the ever-goading canvas . In Alexander Barnett - through his raw , ragged and really realistic THE EYES OF VAN GOGH - we have an actor who seems to be channeling the actual spirit of the artist . For starters , he looks probably the closest to what Van Gogh probably looked like - given that there are no photographs of him as an adult and all we have to go by are his many variegated self-portraits . There are many sequences in this film wherein I felt I was actually looking at the real man , as if caught on some time machine of a film camera . But beyond the outward , it is in the probing of the inward that Mr . Barnett excels . From start to finish , he never loses Van Gogh in himself . There is not a false note in the performance . His acting is a veritable acting class in and of itself . If he and this film had ever been elibigle , his is a performance supremely worthy of an Oscar . The script is sublime . In it , Mr . Barnett dares to bravely show us the darkest sides of Van Gogh . These scenes are painful to watch , if one is totally sold on the Van Gogh-as-Saint interpretation of history . Yet balanced with that blackness , shown are all of the reasons why - as Don McClean sings in STARRY NIGHT - '' this world was never meant for one as beautiful '' as Vincent . If Mr . Barnett 's script were only available in printed form , it would still be in addition to being historically accurate and revealing intense and exciting to read but - in the finished film - these scenes are enacted with such passion and pathos that they seem less acted than lived . As directed by Mr . Barnett , there is a John Cassavettes-like sense of improvisation and therefore total reality that packs one tremendous emotional wallop after another . And like Cassavettes and even Welles in certain instances , Mr . Barnett holds many scenes for incredible amounts of time that lesser directors would be too timid to even attempt . These long , unedited sequences carefully build the utter sense of reality that Mr . Barnett was evidently after and has so eminently achieved . We , as viewers , become part of what we are watching - in ways that are quite rare to most movies . Also in this immense film there are many set-pieces and images that will stay with one for a long , long time . Haunting sequences and rivetting images that are imaginativey conceived and expertly , flawlessly delivered . One example is when Vincent imagines dreams fantasizes hallucinates the death of his beloved brother . After the `` imaginary '' sequence there is a sharp cut to Vincent sitting up in his asylum bed in the middle of the night , crying and cradling what is apparent emptiness - but is , instead , the impossible thought of a lost Theo . Brilliantly , in this one sequence alone , this one image of Vincent cradling `` emptiness '' , volumes are spoken - for in the event of losing Theo , Vincent would indeed be cradling emptiness . But in the larger context , this one image of Vincent cradling `` emptiness '' in the middle-of-the-night speaks largely and painfully for most of the whole of his life . It is in such brilliant , often worldless scenes and sequences that Mr . Barnett 's vision explodes from the film frame as passionately and as profoundly as Vincent van Gogh 's vision exploded from his canvas frames and bathed the world in color and gave us a new way of seeing . As Van Gogh 's work transcended the bounds of its frames , so also does Mr . Barnett 's film transcend the boundaries of the movie or television screen . In both instances , with both artists , Art does what it so rarely does . Art . . . becomes Life .",m,1
"I took a chance on this low cost download , hoping the low-budget art-house movie would interest my mind and entertain me . First , the digital quality forced me to either sit far back or to shrink the image on my screen . I 've have better image quality with VHS videos . The best attributes of the content were a decent makeup face of the actor playing the artist , and a plain-looking painted wall in one of the rooms had some 'potential ' . Other than that , there is nothing to interest the viewer visually . The asylum and people do n't look like late 19th Century southern France . They do n't even try to behave , look , or sound French . Just a little is all that 's needed for the viewers imaginations to pick up on something . No views of the countryside or closeups of anything interesting to set the stage or mood . Lighting skills were absent . The entire first 20 minutes could have been just a few lines with some emotion and visuals to set the tone , but rather it 's an immense amount of words spoken by the actor either to himself or to someone else . Worse , the words are like they are read from a poorly written book . No other conflicts , nothing else going on , and simply no theatrical or cinematic 'artistry ' . After 20 minutes , I fast forwarded to see if anything else happened different , but was disappointed . I 've seen low budget do well before , but this lacks all those little elements that are needed to make it something entertaining .",m,0
"One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white movie is not an especially good movie . BUT , it is a fun movie . It is a silly horror comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios . I love it . Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse . He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler Bela Lugosi . He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar . However , unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office . Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room . When he does try to get out , he ca n't open the door , etc . This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable . But that 's the fun of it . A huge dark creepy house , a will to be read , a suspicious looking butler and cook , a beautiful damsel in distress , a dim witted detective , a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased , murders , trick doors , screams and noises at night , etc . Of course , a very nervous and reluctant hero . This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide . I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun . ~ . ~",f,0
"This is yet another of the gathered-for-the-reading-of-the-will-in-the-spooky-house with-secret-passages-and-a-murderer subgenre . And while I find it hard to believe that there is anyone who legitimately can hate these kind of movies , there are admittedly some that work far better than others . One Body Too Many finds middle ground . < p > It begins with some cleverness in setting up the scenario . The will 's gimmick is farfetched but assured an offbeat night of criminal mayhem : The deceased , an astrologer , wishes to be buried above ground so that the stars shine down on him . If anything happens so that he is not , then the heir who was supposed to get the most will instead get the least , and vice versa . The body disappears , then reappears , then someone else is murdered . . . it 's all expectedly , even appropriately , convoluted . < p > Our hero is a life insurance salesman who is mistaken for the detective assigned to guard the body from shenanigans . And there is real inventiveness in placing a life insurance salesman in this situation , where people are sure to be bumped off . Unfortunately , this knowing wink to the audience is barely explored at all . The hero himself is an average-looking guy , more likable and less wimpy than many 40 's B heroes . And he is surrounded by a capable , if unspectacular , cast . < p > Lugosi is wasted , although his stock Ominous Butler character is interestingly played for laughs this go-round , ready and willing to bump off anybody who anyone else thinks needs bumping off . Watch out for the coffee . This is of course , a comedy mystery , as every picture in this genre has been since The Cat and the Canary in the 20 's . And the comedy is generally the determining factor in how watchable these kind of films are . Here it is not too bad , consisting less of the typical scared mugging and awkward pratfalls than many similar efforts . Only in its dull , protracted middle section does the film lose its way , as the hero gets lost in the ubiquitous secret passageways , caught in a wicker basket with a litter of kittens and wearing only a towel . Do n't ask . < p > There are a number of good scenes , including one where the hero , hiding in a coffin , is carried off and dumped in a pool . The movie ends with a suspenseful chase and confrontation atop the observatory . But there is not enough made of the good ideas in the script , and too much damage is done to the whole by the weak or old ideas in the script . You 've seen much of it before , so it 's not quite worth a purchase . Close but no cigar . < p > See also : The Cat and the Canary ; Black Cat 1941 ; Night Monster ; Old Dark House ; The Monster Walks ; The Gorilla ; Seven Keys To Baldpate ; The Bat Whispers ; and many , many more , if you are so inclined .",m,0
"`` One Body Too Many '' 1944 is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast .

No one knows who is going to get what , they can only guess . . . or does someone know ?

Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs . . . Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs . They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share . Sweet Carol Dunlap Jean Parker is suspected of getting the largest share . Lyle Talbot , who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from `` Death Valley Days . `` The sound track at times indicates this is a `` horror '' film while at other times a comedy .

This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time . The jokes are a bit punny . It is not a blockbuster , but one that certainly can be enjoyed and appreciate by a younger generation .

"My dear , dear friend , & quot ; time-lapse photography , & quot ; introduced itself to me in & quot ; The Time Machine , & quot ; and I was forever changed . It showed me worlds I had not seen , at least , not in a fantastical sense . As a boy in the Seventies , I was not able to see this film in the theater , but the impact it made on me was equal to a nuclear explosion . The giddy feeling of following the intrepid time traveller through the ages was like climbing Everest for the first time , or stepping foot on the Moon . That may be hyperbole , but the thrill of seeing a lit candle melt quickly down to the candlestick in seconds was palpable . Electric . Captivating . I absorbed every image , every sound , and I was there with Rod Taylor every step of the way . It was an exhilerating ride , and it 's one I highly recommend that you take . I hope that the ride is as thrilling for you as it was for me .",m,1
"By today 's standards this movie might be weak . The special effects are primitive and it is not pushing H . G . Well 's point . Nonetheless , I have watched this movie everytime it has appeared on t . v . It has a certain charm and innocence , not to mention that Rod Taylor derserved more work as a leading man . Maybe it is my & quot ; guilty pleasure , & quot ; but this movie never grows tiresome . I recommend this movie to any sic-fi fan and to everyone else ! .",m,1
"This film ranks as quite literaly my all time favorite . It has everything in it : Great sets , great actors , an H G Wells storyline , time travel , monsters , Yvette , the lot . I first watched this movie on a Halloween night on TV many years ago and just fell in love with it . This viewing was years before video became available so all I could look for was a sountrack album to the terrific Garcia score . Nope , it did n't exist . Then along came video . I waited for years before it came out . In all of that time it had not been re-screened on UK TV so I was watching it again with nothing short of a childhood memory that could have been devastated after so many years . This was not to be the case . It was still as good , if not better as I had since read the novel , read up on Pal and knew a lot more about the movie than it was when I first saw it . My wife kind of wishes that I did not like it so much as she finds the poster creepy see front cover of DVD - this was not used on the previous VHS versions and I had hunted high and low to obtain an original cinema poster which now hangs in our study . I am very pleased to see that MGM are tagging on the more recent documentary that was released seperately over here but was so limited in its distribution that I did not get a copy . It features Rod recreating the role of the Time Traveller so I believe , some dialogue and behind the scenes stuff . I can only say that I was excited when Amazon sent the email informing me that the movie was on its way and I ordered one right away . If you 've seen this movie and liked it , I believe that DVD will serve it well . If you have not seen this movie , do n't let the fact that it was made in 1960 put you off . It is a vibrant , action packed spectacular that all should see . Thank you MGM for issuing this classic .",m,1
"It was a great book and although this movie is a bit different from the original book , the movie gives us a great look at the view of the future in the 1960 's . Obviously H . G . Well could not imagine a nuclear holocaust to destroy what we know of civilization , but it is a better explanation then what the book gives us and is easier to relate to . H . G . Wells was trying to show us the downfall of civilization through industrialization , and the movie shows us the modern problem of the 1960 's .",m,1
"I watched the remake of the Time Machine and expected it to be awesome . It was n't awesome , but it was ok . The special effects were really cool and all , but the story itself seemed to move too fast . I then went and rented the original Time Machine . I liked the original far more than the remake . The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better . I will admit -- the special effects were cheesy , but what can you expect ? ? This movie was made in 1960 ! ! If you want to see a great movie that has mystery , horror , action , and suspense , this is the one to buy . I reccommend this highly to everyone ! !",m,1
"Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time . Great special effects . . . remember when people built stuff out of real things and had to suspend your disbelief without crappy ass flimsy transparent souless computer graphics ? I 'm telling you man , the entrance to the Morlock Caves exists . . . a truly resourceful ingenius use of special effects for its time ! As a young lad I watched this movie countless times . Dad 's , get this movie for your adolescent son . He will love it . I 've never seen the remake . . . I 'm sure it sucks for air . The music is fantastic and is half the experience . George Pal predicted the moptop haircut with the Eloi actors only a couple years before the British Invasion . The extras are actually worth watching with an added scene made quite a few years later . . . highly amusing . And it 's got Mr . Ed 's owner in it and he 's a superb actor . . . now c'mon ! Get the credit card out ! And then there 's the part when he spins the talking coins and they tell of the recent past . And there 's the part with the nuclear bomb and the lava and then he sets fire to a Morlock and he explodes and then and then and then . . . . it 's awesome .",m,1
"This film has become a fiction classic . Based in an other classic fiction writer , H . G . Wells . A must seen film for all fiction lovers",m,1
"When I first saw this movie I was only 8 . I saw it on TV and -due to the TV set-in B & W not it color . However it had a great impact on me because of the incredible and magical special effects . For a small boy years away from the computers enviroment this was the very best movie of all . . . and it still is . I wonder why George Pal never become such a great entrepreneur as Walt Disney . Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures . And in speaking of pictures , Pal and Disney established their own landmarks , from my point of view , with `` The Time Machine '' and `` 20 , 000 Leagues under the Sea '' respectively . `` The Time Machine '' may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking : it makes you believe for a moment it 's possible to travel through time .",m,1
"Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood : bubblegum trading cards , comic books , and George Pal movies . The early sixties was a great time to be a kid . With other classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth to entertain our eager young minds , our eyes frequently popped at the terrific adventures we witnessed onscreen . The Time Machine endures as great cinematic storytelling . When I was little , the movie scared me . Remember , the atomic attack comes in 1966 , which was still the future for us then . My favorite part has always been when George fast-forwards in his lab . However , that gave me some anxiety at the time because it disturbed me that he was leaving home and maybe never coming back . I thought the Morlocks were great monsters and seem to recall my friends and I dividing up between Morlocks and Eloi for some play fighting later . Of course it was more fun to be a Morlock than an Eloi . But if you got to be Rod Taylor , then you had ARRIVED . One of the interesting things I noted on my last viewing was the technology . 80 . 000 years into the future , what remains of knowledge is stored on old `` rings '' that spin to speak . I turned and looked at my ten-year-old son and said , `` That could be cds ! `` Round , shiny discs that play an audio recording when spinning-sounds just like a cd to me . Even in 1960 , this was amazingly prophetic . Also , I mentioned how great it would be to have a replica of the time machine . Then , `` our host '' , Robert Osbourne remarked as to how the prop had become lost and then years later bought at a THRIFT STORE ! Just imagine that lucky son-of-a-gun . It 's a shame that we 've grown to a time when special effects take precedent over character and story . Fortunately , an occassional film comes forward with both like LOTR but the newer Time Machine is not one of these . Rod Taylor and George Pal 's version is the one to see . Made in the midst of the Cold War , it 's a question of where are we going as a species : annihilation or ascension . Ultimately , it is an optimistic piece about the noble possibilities that endure despite neverending conflicts inherent in the human experience . Every generation has its Morlocks , and our choice remains : Are we Rod Taylor or an Eloi ?",m,1
"I can not say how faithful this movie is to the book , however it is an outstanding science fiction movie . The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today , but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay . Rod Taylor 's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note . The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done . It is a classic story well adapted to the screen . I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans .",m,1
"The Time Machine is one of the best science fiction films made and it has always been one of my favorites ! The first time I watched this was when I was in the first grade . The movie is about an inventor named George [ Rod Taylor ] who has greated a time machine and goes on a journey into the year 802701 . < p > The movie starts out when you see David Filby [ one of George 's friends ] walking up to George 's house where you see some more of his friends . Then eventually you see George but he 's been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey . Then he talks about the story . < p > In the next part , George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want 's to proove that time travel really exists . But , when his friends do n't believe him he decides to go on the long journey . < p > Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701 . Instead of having a lot of technology it 's just an area of grass . There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks . The morlocks give the Eloi their food , clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them . So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her . But , soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi do n't work very much and they mostly just play , so he goes back to his machine . But , thats when the trouble begins . The morlocks have stolen his machine ! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place . So , the only thing left to do is go to the underground area , kill the morlocks , save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time . < p > When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion . < p > In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again . < p > The special features include : Behind the scenes documentary time machine : the journey back , hosted by Rod Taylor and featuring Alan Young , Whit Bissel and others involved in the film soundtrack remastered in dolby digital 5 . 1 . Interactive Menus Theatrical Trailer , Filmogaphies of Tayor , Yvette Mimieux , Young and George Pal scene access , languages and subtitles in english and francais . < p > I loved every single part of this movie all the way through , the story is just amazing ! ! < p > This is a sci-fi classic everyone should own ! ! !",m,1
"If I only had a machine like that . . . . . . This movie get your attention and your curiosity . What would you do in the actor 's shoes ? . I only wish I had a machine like that . . . . . . . Overall : EXCELLENT . By the way , the new version on this movie is a joke . This is the one to watch .",m,1
"We watched this on Prime , being familiar with the story from a children 's book that our kids have . Given the age of the movie 1960 I did n't know what to expect . I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the acting , the sets , and the story itself . Obviously there are a few parts that are comically terrible given what we 're accustomed to in sci-fi and CGI today . But they do n't really detract from the overall experience , and the parts that are done well are simply excellent . Recommended .",m,1
"For a film from the 50 's , this one delivers . Would recommend this one to anyone , especiallysi-fi nuts like myself . You 'll enjoy it .",m,1
This was one of my favorite movies growing up at the Saturday matinees . The other one being Mysterious Island . I had problems with the sound and the actors not being in sync with what they were saying . Maybe it was just my computer but it was a problem .,m,1
I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down . personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake .,m,1
"Others have said it better so I 'll keep my review brief . The restoration work on this film is excellent : great sound , colors bright and sharp . DVD plays perfectly and there is a bonus on here of a documentary about the restoration of said machine , hosted by Rod Taylor , who is reunited with his old friend , Alan Young . They even do a short skit where Taylor attempts to rescue Alan Young 's character from his date with destiny tries to stop him from leaving for France , where he was killed in WWI , which gives fans of this great film one extra moment with the Time Machine cast members . I recommend the DVD to anyone who loves this great H . G . Wells story .",m,1
"Time travel has always fascinated me , and of course The Time Machine is the most basic time travel movie ever , right ? I 've never had a chance to read the book , but I found this an excellent film whose special effects stand up well to the test of time . Today 's digital age can make flowers bloom and snails race across the floor more realistically , but the scenes of the sun flying across the sky , for example , were great . And the real beauty of the movie was the story and the message behind it . It 's hard to judge anything that might happen 800 , 000 years into the future . Progressive authors have made some interesting predictions in the past look at the awesome flat-screen TVs in < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000087F6L '' > Fahrenheit 451 < a > ! . This story - and nothing we currently know , I imagine , will still be remembered in 800 , 000 years . H . G . Wells 's predictions will not be judged . But in the meantime , it was still an incredibly fun story . The only thing I found disturbing was that the Eloi came across so heartless . They were on the surface a peaceful people , but did n't have any attachments to each other . They were unconcerned when they lost members of their own families . Even in 800 , 000 years , I do n't really buy that people would evolve to that point .",f,1
"THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday , then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again . Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind , the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life . My own wondrous `` journey into the future '' via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s , and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions . This is a film that truly delivers . The special effects are outstanding . . . the acting superb . . . the drama riveting ! Rod Taylor , as the inventor of the time machine , is relentlessly -- believably ! -- heroic in the role of H . G . Wells ; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena ; Alan Young 's sensitive portrayal of David Filby the only one of Wells ' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells ' `` outlandish '' theories makes a lasting impression on the viewer . And one of the major , not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia , which I 'm listening to now as I write this review . The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama , while the `` London '' theme tugs gently at the heartstrings . There 's one gorgeous passage here that 's straight out of Debussy . Has anyone made note of it ? Do n't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world , and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago .",m,1
"The movie was bought for my English class to watch after they read the book . They were a little skeptical because it was filmed a while ago , but they ended up enjoying it . The DVD was in great condition .",f,1
"After all these years , `` The Time Machine '' 1960 remains a very entertaining movie . Of the five or six films produced by George Pal , `` The Time Machine '' , which was also directed by him , along with `` The War of the Worlds '' 1953 are probably his finest films . Both films are loosely based on the novels of H . G . Wells and , for their time , boasted state of the art special effects , for which both films won an Oscar . Rod Taylor is the lead character , supposedly H . G . Wells himself , who claims to his friends to have invented a time machine , allowing him to travel back and forth in time . His brief discussion with his friends , attempting to explain the principles of time travel , similar to the Wells novel , makes it seem almost plausible until one thinks about it a little longer . Taylor , whose British accent slowly fades away as the picture goes on , plays his character earnestly and is surrounded by an able cast : Sebastian Cabot , Tom Helmore , Whit Bissell , Yvette Mimieux , Doris LLoyd , very likable as his house maid , and , in particular , Alan Young , who delivers a perfect Scottish accent , as his devoted but practical-minded Scottish friend . Why not ? Alan Young grew up in Edinburgh . The special effects for this film are basically simple but effective , using time-lapse photography to simulate the acceleration of events that one would supposedly witness if he were rapidly moving forward in time . His journey , after a few brief stops to observe the two World Wars and a nuclear attack pointedly set in the mid 1960s , ultimately takes him several hundred thousand years into the future in which he encounters a race of `` beautiful people '' , the Eloi and a race of barbarous beings called the Morlocks who are literally living off the Eloi . At this point the screen play of the picture and the novel of H . G . Wells part company , the movie pretty much resorting to melodramatic action for its resolution . The video quality of the DVD is very good and the sound recording , as a pleasant surprise , is in genuine and high quality stereophonic sound although it was never presented that way in any theater in which I saw this film . The music is a rich orchestral score by Russ Garcia and adds a good deal to the effectiveness of the film . I thinks it 's safe to say that this film version of the Wells novel , with all of its shortcomings , still betters the 2002 remake in spite of the technical superiority of the newer film . Alan Young makes a brief but welcome cameo appearance in the 2002 film which , unfortunately , fails to convey the atmosphere of H . G . Wells that the older film , at least in places , manages to accomplish ,",m,1
"In addition to an all-time excellent movie , this edition supplies interviews with the cast and those who worked on the film with them . A very touching scene is played out between Rod Taylor and Alan Ladd , reprising their roles in the movie . This is too good of a deal to pass up . Glad I bought mine !",m,1
"Good movie in spite of the hokey special effects . But , considering what they had to work with , it is very good .",m,1
Remake of the original classic is a classic in itself . Great fantasy movie . . . great acting by all . A must own movie !,f,1
One 's imaginagion can not help but be stirred after viewing this timeless masterpiece . If you 're looking for a pleasant hour-plus of sci-fi type entertainment then this one is for you . Enjoy !,m,1
"When I was a kid I ca n't recall how many times I watched this film on the television , but it was always among my favorites . It still is . What 's great about getting older is how your experiences can actually improve on something that 's already among your favorites . Sadly , it also diminishes some of the things you thought you liked . Everything about this film now has the weight of emotional maturity working for it . Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world , even for what he thought was a brief trip , holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then . That 's especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event . This film opens with a restless man stuck in an age , his age , where he despises man 's futility but accepts that life amicably enough . It ends in a similar manner but now that man holds a sense of purpose , a goal he has set and will fulfill to the best of his ability . He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive . The FX of this film are dated . They have to be . But the story itself is timeless . Forgive the pun . The one disappointment is the battle towards the end . The Morlocks are not as scary as before . They 're just as vile , but pathetic . I also wish George Pal had insisted on a scene from the book where the time traveller sees the future after the Morlock time when the sun is dimming . Anyway , this has worn very well with age .",m,1
"A great movie . My family has watched it several times , and never get tired of it .",f,1
"The Time Machine is one hour and forty-three minutes long and was released on August 17 , 1960 . The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells George to his friends who invents a time machine . George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future . The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive . George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm . Just at the four guests are about to dine , George enters the room dirty and clothes torn . George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine . When the four friends leave the house , George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature . At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12 , 802 , 701 . George lands in an almost paradise world . The only downside is that there are two different classes of people . The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws , government and civilization . They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well . The Elois speak in a childlike way . The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground , operates the machinery , blue-skinned , and can not stand the light . The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks . The Morlocks clothe , feed , and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults . George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end . When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from . George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from . His four friends do not believe his story , but David Filby seems to believe some of it .

"Just re-watched this movie this weekend and forgot how good it was . Alan Young plays Taylor 's best friend and there are great behind-the-scenes stories for this movie in Young 's book MISTER ED AND ME I believe that is the title also available on Amazon . com . If you love Morlocks , beautiful women , Oscar winning special effects and clever plots , this movie is for you .",m,1
"I first viewed this film when I was 11 years old and I must confess that seeing this movie impacted my whole life . I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors . The time machine itself , is so humorous , but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption . I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day . My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life . I consider this a much better movie than its `` twin '' Journey to the Center of the Earth , but they were both great and thought-provoking , especially to pre-teenagers . The scenes and special effects are phenomenal . It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own . Rod Taylor was not my favorite actor , but he did a very good job in this movie .",f,1
"I was very pleased with thr DVD `` The Time Machine '' , mailed to me recently . It was in excellent condition and met my expectations . Thank you .",f,1
"Its the greatest , like you saw it the first time . It has n't changed , maybe it has change a bit . LOOK OUT PAST , HERE COMES THE BEST ! !",f,1
"THE TIME MACHINE tells the story of Rod Taylor , an enterprising Victorian scientist who develops a way-back machine that crushes four dimensions into three , so that human beings can be transported through time as well as through space . The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed , and Rod Taylor , the Australian he-man star , does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around . His first moments inside the machine are thrilling , as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him , then light again , then dark , then whole months pass within instants , and then whole years . When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races , the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid , the other brainiac weaklings . Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production , and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen , while the Eloi were us , castrated professors educated out of our balls . Rod Taylor 's mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night . Yvette Mimieux is Weena , exquisitely elfin and needy , in her leaf-colored linen dress , falling for George HG Wells , Rod Taylor 's character despite her natural antipathy towards dark men . This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet , oddly enough , it is perfect for young children . Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time . Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy , all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks , pitied the Eloi , and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world . Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1 , 000 , 000 years from now where Weena waits for him ? It 's a treat on DVD , as are the special features and commentary , but Alan Young does n't seem to have a bit of shame in him ; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie .",m,1
"George Pal 's classic movie is a delight from begining to end , and , surprisingly , much closer to Well 's book than his great grandson 's lame remake , with much creepier Morlocks . The documentary on the DVD is a mixed bag , with great stuff about what has become of the machine itself , it 's rescue and restoration , and also odd stuff with Alan Young and Rod Taylor in a sequel scene that contradicts the movie . The documentary is dedicated to the memories of George Pal and Mike Minor , the latter a friend of mine who is much missed . Skip the remake and enjoy the original .",m,1
"I saw this movie when I was a kid and it stood with me ever since . I just love the film , the machine and the overall plot . It just keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know more as the movie unfold . The simple but yet clear scientifical explanation early on in the film is a great suspense setter . Overall : EXCELLENT .",m,1
"I saw this as a kid when I was at my grandma 's house and I really enjoyed it . I have watched it again as an adult and still find it to be just as entertaining . It 's about a man who builds a time machine and goes into the future . He finds humans and a mutant cannibalistic breed of humans who live underground and eat normal humans . He meets a very pretty woman named Weena and they and the others must confront the monsters . It has a great ending and though the special effects are VERY dated , it 's still really cool to see the time-lapse effect as he travels through the centuries . The movie is squeaky clean , has little kissing , mild action and is ok for most kids . It 's a little scary in some parts but the monsters look so cheesy it 's sort of funny . I find it really interesting to watch movies that my parents and grandparents saw . I think this movie is a classic and will be enjoyed for many more generations .",f,1
"Based on the famous novel of H . G . Wells , a young inventor constructs a device thatenables him to travel to the future , to see what the future will depart us . But this somber gaze has nothing to do with a promissory future where harmony and peace will reign . Regardless the spanning years , the film still strike you . Memorable special effects and imaginative stages , where the vigorous profile of Rod Taylor is admirably compensated with that sidereal beauty who Yvette Mimieux was . Georges Pal would eventually the same director of the famous cult movie : '' the seven faces of Dr . Lao . ``",m,1
"I 've had the Time Machine on VHS forever it seems . Taped it off the TV years ago . But when I saw this DVD , it blew me away ! I had NO IDEA ! Never have I seen every colour in his jacket , every grain of dirt , every hair on his head with such clarity . The time machine absolutely shines with beauty too . I sat with my jaw hanging open and goose bumps on my arms even as soon as the opening credits when I heard the surround sound kick in . My VHS copy always had a really bad audio track , but on the DVD , you can actually hear the faint electrical buzz of the machine running in the lab before he hits that crystal lever . I saw and heard things I never knew existed in this movie . And it has a fabulous documentary with it , hosted by Rod Taylor , that explains everything we always wondered like what happened to that little model of the machine that he put the cigar in , and the full scale machine itself has a story that you wo n't believe ! All in all , it 's a wonderful movie , and everything a DVD should be . Brilliant , vibrant , with gut vibrating audio . and still better than the remake that was just in theatres Fantastic !",f,1
"Great movie about a man who travels through time into the future , and then finds his lover who is absolutley beautiful in the year 800 , 000 . Buy this one , it 's a classic",m,1
"Though the film has flaws , mostly on the corney side , I think it is safe to say that this is the best adaptation of one of H . G . Wells ' novels to film yet produced . Wells imaginatively projected the `` class struggle '' pondered by Marx of the capitalist owners vs . workers without a share in the means of production 800 , 000 years into the future . In this way , combining with Darwinian evolution , it becomes a struggle between two sub-species : the underground machine-lord cannibal `` Morlocks '' vs . the above ground , sunshine-loving `` Eloi , `` who the Morlocks simply breed as cattle . In Wells ' fancy , the differences between classes will become so extreme assuming the absence of an earlier , political solution , there will eventually be an ironic ambiguity as to which class is really which . To its merit , this is evident enough in the film ; but the film adds to that a couple of dated innaccurate predictions concerning the `` near '' future now past . The result is a risky and somewhat corney ride . Yet this addition is also fairly well off-set by the fact that the time traveller is allowed to start his journey from the late 19th century and so from Wells ' own time , as in the novel . The film here has a vivid , added dimesion of the curiosity of a time machine starting its career before high tech -- evidently by the sheer genius of a lone inventor . This device was used by subsequent time travel films -- as well as by other Wells-to-film attempts , like The First Men in the Moon , but never as effectively . In the end , the film successfully portrays a maverick and human hero the time traveller , who is never quite at home in and so rises above any period of time -- one who the audience is at least allowed to hope for -- without in any way compromising the scope of Wells ' intent . Perhaps it is even some return trip of the time traveller to those `` horse and buggy '' days which changes the innacurate `` predictions '' to recent history as we actually know it -- a possibility plainly allowed for though not shouted out by the screenplay . A question for familiar viewers -- would Filby really just let his son Jamie die and his store be destoyed , for apparently no good reason -- after having received due warning ? The time-lapse photography for the time travel scenes are put to very good use . The visual appearance of the machine in the film , extrapolated from Wells ' descriptions , is a remarkable feat of imagination and ingenuity , and is the envy of every true sci-fi buff . A scene where the time traveller takes a moment to gaze upon and walk about his creation before embarking on his first journey , looking on it with admiration , amazement and anticipation as if the machine itself were a discovery more than an invention , seamlessly pregnant with the endless adventures it promises , is even breathtaking . The Hollywood swashbuckling and boy-meets-girl aspects are present but not overblown . The wonder of time meets technology is intelligently dealt with , as is the wonder of a man who steps out of his own time . In this respect it is very fun to watch the time traveller try to kindle the spark of curiosity and wonder in the spiritually deadened descendents of the future , who are plainly depicted as having their forerunners stemming back as far as the late 1800 's the time traveller having had similar trouble at that time as well , trying to wake up closed-minded friends and aquaintances as he argues with them about the value of time-travel . The near-futility of his stuggle is very forceful , vivid and effective . The casting is flawless and the acting is excellent , especially for the two main characters , the unnamed by Wells , `` Time Traveler '' though very subtly given the cameo name in the film of H . George Wells -- the first initial H . followed by `` George Wells '' only briefly appearing in shots of the time machine 's control panel , where the inventor stylistically ingraved it -- though his friends do call him George and his tiny , delicate and fun-loving girlfriend from the future , Weena . Incidentally , the 2002 Dreamworks remake is good , but really has nothing to do with Wells ' novel . One nice twist is the albino and articulate Morlock . Weena is still pretty , but has nothing to do with Wells ' novel -- even her name gets changed to `` Mara . `` The time machine itself is also good very good , though it is impossible to believe it was constructed in 1899 . Not so for the 1960 film ; I believe it every time -- '' If someone had made a time machine in 1899 that somehow actually worked , that is what it would have looked like . `` Overall , in terms of sets and direction in the `` remake , `` the distant future does not appear as distant and exotic as in the earlier film . Distorted beyond recognition in the 2002 remake is the foreboding , silent future image of the Sphinx , towering over the time traveller when he first arrives in the year 802 , 701 . This image from the novel is present in 1960 film , and is intended to invoke the tantalizing theme of `` the riddle of the Sphinx '' -- what is the difference between man and beast ? Yet in this remake there are few mysteries . Overall , the film has the same failings , while at the same time being `` maverick '' gets reduced to the mundane , like wearing a hat not yet in style . Notably absent is the nearly-futile and perennial struggle of the hero . Does the 1960 version solve the riddle of the Sphinx ? I think it hints at a solution : at the end of the movie , the housekeeper , Mrs . Watchett evidently a widow , but not evidently without children , befriending Filby , evidently wishes to keep the house light going in at least in one window in case of the Time Traveller 's return -- as such she also evidently represents the future Eloi ; the scene is shot just as we must imagine that Weena is also awaiting the Time Traveller 's return . It is his businessmen friends who become the Morlock -- though Filby is the ambiguous go between .",m,1
THIS IS ONE OF H . G . WELLS CLASSICS . I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT . IT 'S JUST AS GOOD NOW AS IT WAS THEN . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE .,m,1
The Time Machine is a `` deep thought '' movie . This has always been a favorite of mine . I have watched it many times .,m,1
"The time machine was an excellent movie . I highly recommend it . Rod Taylor is a superb actor , and makes this movie a classic .",f,1
"There are a lot of reviews about this great picture and how it influenced an entire generation . All of it is true ! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder . We can thank Mr . Wells for creating the story , but we really owe it to George Pal , Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure . The real draw of course is & quot ; The Time Machine & quot ; prop . Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired . The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved . All of the elements of Victorian London in winter , cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner , & quot ; tea table & quot ; chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting . When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor . As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you can not help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention ! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a & quot ; cold war & quot ; interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the & quot ; future & quot ; on August 18th , 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust . From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture . The care that went into this DVD should not be understated . It is a highly polished film that restores 20 20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there . Once again , we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in , the clear sky above the Eloi & quot ; cafeteria & quot ; and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns . When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that & quot ; that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time & quot ; and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs . Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again , because you are in love with a romantic idea , TIME TRAVEL .",m,1
"The Time Machine had a great effect on me . I found it to be enjoyable and it had very fascinating theories throughout . What I liked most in the book was the interesting characters , H . G . Wells ' style of writing , the parallel of Eloi and Morlocks to society now , how the book always kept my attention , and finally I liked how the narrator left us questioning the conclusion of the novel . First , I liked how interesting the characters were simply because that is a vital aspect to a good novel . I was impressed by the Time Traveller , and how he was determined to prove his machine to be a success . The characters whom attended his dinners always seemed a little skeptical of his ideas and theories . The Time Traveller explains his discovery of the fourth-dimension and the Psychologist interrupts stating , & quot ; You can move about in all directions of space , but you can not move about in Time & quot ; III . 13 . 16 . The second thing I liked about the novel was the authors ' style of writing . Wells remained descriptive throughout the book . For a novel based on imagination and theories , I found it important that Wells had kept some reality in it . Reality being the descriptive details in the novel . With all these crazy ideas going on in the book , Wells had to keep our minds somewhat intact to what his visions were . The Time Traveller describes the Eloi 's as being & quot ; very beautiful and graceful creatures , but indescribably frail . His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive-that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much & quot ; III . 34 . 33 . Another aspect of the novel I enjoyed , was the parallel of the Eloi and Morlocks to society now . We begin to understand that the Eloi and Morlocks are humans after great evolution and time . It amazed me to see how society completely divided itself between graceful creatures and creatures of the underworld . The fourth thing I liked was how the book kept my attention the whole way through . I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next or how the Time Traveller was going to escape the Morlocks and get back to his machine . Finally , I really enjoyed how the narrator concludes the Time Travellers disappearance . The narrator says , & quot ; The Time Traveller vanished three years ago . And , as everybody knows now , he has never returned & quot ; XII . 124 . 18 . I liked this because it made you question whether the Time Traveller had vanished into the future forever , whether he had always been from a past time and had gone back , or what was to come of him ? So , as it began with one mans ' imagination , it ends with your own .",f,1
"This is a great anniversary edition of this sci-fi classic , however , the seller failed to do a quality check before shipping . The case was damaged inside and a piece of the plastic was rubbing on the recorded side od the DVD making scratches all over . The quality of the video was then , of course , damaged also . Lesson : check before you ship . I 'll reorder it , probably from a different supplier .",m,1
"I love the old movies of the past , and this one is at top of my list . The quality of picture , sound and color is beyond my best hopes . I feel sorry for the people who give this on less than five stars , if there were ten , i would give them .",m,1
I have enjoyed watching this movie ever since it came out . First time was in black and white . Makes one think about how things could turn out .,m,1
This is a great movie & has been updated considerably visually over the original . The quality of the image is much better & more clear . It 's the same original movie but even more enjoyable to watch now . The DVD I received is perfect quality for a used movie . I highly recommend used movies from Amazon . They are great to replace older movies on VCR tape . The prices are very good .,f,1
"This show is still one of the best movies I have ever enjoyed , top 5 , the book is great too , it is a true classic and a fantastic story ! ! I saw it at the old Avalon theater in Chicago , when it first came out , it was out of sight then & it still is . Good old memories . Enjoy it .",m,1
"Really Great to see this clasic again . Arrived in good time , no defects and good condition . thank you",m,1
"Excellent acting by Taylor , Young , Cabot , and Mimieux sp ? . Good sets and fine if now outdated story . To reviewer Michael Butts . Giant was directed by George Stevens , not George Pal .",f,1
"Director George Pal will probably be more remembered for this film than any of his other classics , including & quot ; Giant . & quot ; Why ? Remember , this is 1960 , and whether or not Pal 's version is true to Wells ' book is not the issue . Marvel at the unique special effects , including the mannequin 's many transformations , the way the clouds scurry across the window ; the lush but sterile world of the eloi and morlocks . This is quite groundbreaking in the world of cinema , long before the CGI and animatronics guys came along . Rod Taylor The Birds , TV 's Falcon Crest is the perfect studly hero , but he also possesses a sensitivity uncommon in movies of the 60s , which is all more evident in his friendship with the delightful Alan Young Tom Thumb , Mr . Ed . Add a trio of our most respected character actors Sebastian Cabot , Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore to lend upper crust credence . And how can one forget the lovely Yvette Mimieux . Yvette came to audiences attentions in a two part Dr . Kildare episode . She played his love interest , a surfer with elilepsy , who dies in the final moments . She also played the troubled young girl in & quot ; Where the Boys Are & quot ; and in the 1970s starred in a rarely known cult classic , & quot ; Hit Lady . & quot ; Her beautiful innocence is captured in this movie . Yes , it 's campy , a little corny in its naivete about man 's future , but as a scifi film , it 's one of the best and far surpasses its glitzy remake with Guy Pearce .",m,1
"THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC FROM THE SIXTIES . GOOD ACTION , WELL MADE , THEY DO N'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE",m,1
"Unlike the recent re-make this flows more of the book diologe . . . . I give it good acting credit , Alough I think it does kinda lack the classic touch but it was the good classic tech not the best but good Ide suggest renting it , buy it if you relly like it ! .",m,1

"Although quite different in tone and content from the original novel by H . G . Wells , George Pal 's Oscar winner for Special Effects , The Time Machine convincingly conveys the wonder and mystery of time travel . Rod Taylor 's highly believable and intense portrayal of the time traveler is a major strength of the film . Even though the special effects are & quot ; dated & quot ; and reveal at times the & quot ; effects & quot ; of low budget , they manage to hold up over repeated viewings much like Pal 's The War of the Worlds . The Victorian atmosphere of The Time Machine is as vivid as the strangeness of the world in 802 , 701AD . In spite of its genre ' , the film manages to effectively portray the need for preserving our human-ness throughout time . If the obvious adherence to Hollywood comic book rescue adventure and romance are given poetic license , the film is still very unique , entertaining , and worth having in one 's film library .",m,1
"The Time Machine is a Science Fiction classic . George Pal too H . G . Wells & # 65533 ; s classic story and made it a reality . From the costumes to the intricately detailed Time Machine itself , the movie is a stand out in special effects , art direction and make-up . < p > Rod Taylor was fantastic and played his character with a real sense of amazement . If you have seen the new version & # 65533 ; it lacks a real important element & # 65533 ; characters anyone cares about . This movie has a charm and romance that Yvette Mimoeux could only portray . < p > Even George Pal & # 65533 ; s visions of what the 80 & # 65533 ; and 90 & # 65533 ; s would be like are not far off . Who could forget the classic mannequin in the window sequence & # 65533 ; watching fashion styles change before our eyes . The key to most of the special effects in the film was of course & # 65533 ; stop motion animation . Whereby , elements and props and sets are shot one frame at a time while slight movements were made between each exposed frame . Thanks to CGI technology these days & # 65533 ; this has almost become a lost art form . When it is done well , like in this movie & # 65533 ; it really is effective and shines . < p > The DVD extras on this one are great . A television retrospective shot in the mid 90 & # 65533 ; s with some of the original cast is really well done . The behind the scenes and event he history of what happened to the original Time Machine are on this documentary . < p > This is a must DVD for Science Fiction fans . A true classic and a very good DVD for anyone 's collection .",m,1
"George Pal 's films have always had a warm and fuzzy feeling - except this one . However , how else would such a creative genius and pioneer in stop-motion approach such a bleak story but with a hopeful tone . The charactors - Alan Young 's Mr . Philby stands out - add flesh to the Victorian era story of an inventor who could easily destroy the world , but winds up possibly saving mankind from itself . The special effects were good for their time and the acting pretty much stands up and Yvette Mimmieux looks fabulous ! but the story and the kindly treatment by Mr . Pal are everything .",m,0
"An anti-war theme is prominent throughout this classic sci-fi flick . In the lead you have Rod Taylor starring as inventor H . G . Wells , a man seeking relief from , and improvement of , the world in which he lives . Demonstrating a miniature version of his time machine for a trio of friends including Sebastian Cabot of `` Family Affair '' fame on New Year 's Eve 1899 , he laments that he was born in the wrong time . . . and that he would like to journey into the future to live among more civilized peoples . He desires the utopia that he thinks technology will inevitably bring , but also cries out at the corruption of technology for other than peaceful purposes . < p > His journey , however , leaves him feeling overwhelmed as it is far from what he expects . He initially watches the years go by from his machine as represented by a manequin he observes in a shop window across the street . There , he views what he regards as a harbinger of societal descent into a more liberal way of life . As fashions change dramatically over the decades , he blushingly remarks , `` You call that a dress ? `` . He makes three intermediate stops on his way to his ultimate destination -- the first in 1917 , the second in 1940 , and the third in 1964 . They all , conveniently , coincide with raging wars the final one , a ficticious World War III fought with nuclear weapons that lasts for 326 years . < p > Embittered and frightened , he moves on , ultimately coming to a stop some 800 , 000 years in the future . Wells is initially delighted with his new-found utopia and attempts to befriend the native Eloi , a blond-haired , blue-eyed , fair-skinned Aryan race of humans . He is quickly repulsed as he sees them passively watch as one of their own Weena , played by the lovely Yvette Mimieux starts to drown only a few feet from the others . After saving her , he learns that they are nothing more than a race of slow-witted , cowardly do-nothings who rely on the sinister Morlocks for survival . < p > The Morlocks , who look like a cross between the Hulk and the gill man on `` The Creature from the Black Lagoon , `` were the humans who chose to continue living underground after the end of the last war . They deevolved physically and morally and , as a result , developed into ravenous cannibals who fattened up the Eloi so as to devour them at a later date eating the oldest ones first . < p > There is no written word within either culture and that lends itself to the theory that cultures tend to stagnate without the written word . Without books there is no learning beyond pure observation and word of mouth and , in this case , both races eventually lost whatever skills and knowledge they once possessed . < p > Eventually , the Eloi and Morlocks took on a primitive symbiotic relationship . You have the peace-loving , vegetarian , let-nature-take-its-course Eloi one one side , and the militaristic they still use air raid sirens to hypnotize the Eloi , meat-eating of a sort , control-your-own-destiny Morlocks . Despite his appreciation for much of the Eloi philosophy -- he initially mistakes them for economic genuises -- he quickly realizes the truth about them and grows disgusted with their apathetic attitude towards self-improvement and advancement . Ironically , circumstances dictate him teaching the Eloi the value of fighting back , a trait he abhorred . As a result , the Eloi defeat the Morlock in a demonstration that while war may be bad it can also be the LESSER of two evils . Still , after their victory , the Eloi are left to answer the question `` How do we fend for ourselves now ? `` . Wells chooses to stay among them , returning to his time only long enough to retrieve three books to help them in their journey . In the final scene of the movie , one of the inventor 's friends discusses Well 's future with Well 's housekeeper . He finally asks her and the audience , `` Which three books would you have chosen ? `` . < p > The film confronts the positives and negatives of pacifism vs . militarism and , in an overall generic sense , liberalism vs . conservatism , all with regard to the survival and growth of a society . Eventually , the movie shows that raging examples of either philosophy is n't the solution -- that the true solution resides closer to the middle of the spectrum with the pendulum tilting into conservative territory . < p > The story is timeless , the script and acting good , and George Pal 's special effects excellent considering the age of the movie . The movie 's depth is often overlooked , and it is a worthy addition to any DVD library .",m,1
"IN A NUTSHELL : H . G . WELLS 'S 'TIME MACHINE ' IS INTERPRETED IN FILM BY GEORGE PALOkay , this is an old film and might it look quaint to some of our younger movie-goers , but to those of us that grew up around films like 'The Time Machine ' , this is pure wonder . This film is quite true to the original literary work penned by H . G . Wells in 1895 and uses a realistic victorian motif combined with a crystal powered time machine to power the film . GOOD STORY + GOOD ACTING & SPECIAL EFFECTS = TIMELESS CLASSICThe 'Special Effects ' were made the old-fashioned way , but they worked well enough to get Tim Baar and Gene Warren an Oscar nomination for 'Best Visual Effects ' . They cleverly illustrated the passage of time as the time machine traveled through the fourth dimension by utilizing a number of clever devices such as ; rapidly growing and ripening apples over what appeared to be seconds , shrinking candlesticks as we watched , a mannequin that changed with the fashions as we watched , the sun and moon arcing overhead in a heartbeat , superfast appearing snails , rapidly decomposing morlochs and much more . Rod Taylor as H . G . Wells did play a rather bare knuckled hero , but he showed conviction and passion in the role that helped to suspend our disbelief . Yvette Mimieux as Weena , a young blond Eloi , was quite a scene stealer without doing anything special in particular . Perhaps she just looked the part of a young eloi woman so well and attractively that it made Rod Taylor 's character want to stay in the future an easy sell for both him and the audience . I can recall seeing the film as a youngster and as soon as I saw Weena I thought , `` now he 's [ Rod Taylor ] just got to stay '' . -- -- - > THE PRINCIPAL PLAYERS & lt ; -- -- -Rod Taylor - George , H .

BOTTOM LINE : CHEMISTRY BETWEEN WEENA & GEORGE ADD EMOTION TO THIS FANTASY EVENTA very interesting and entertaining effort by George Pal includes a wonderful script based on H . G . Wells 's novel , a fitting musical score by Russell Garcia , breathtaking cinematography by Paul Vogel and incredible visual effects for 1960 by Gene Warren and Tim Baar . Having said all that , for me , it was the chemistry between Rod Taylor as George and Yvette Mimieux as Weena that make this film a classic that endures . It is surprising just how much Mimieux as Weena gets across without saying very much to the all too loquacious George , and ultimately to the audience .",f,1

"Skip the godawful remake that 's in theaters right now , and get the original instead . This is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time , and the DVD restoration is great . < p > The movie itself has much to recommend it . It follows the book very closely , Rod Taylor was an excellent choice for the lead , and the special effects which won an Oscar in 1960 have aged surprisingly well . < p > It takes place in 1899 , and a great deal of effort was taken to ensure historic authenticity . The time machine itself is a beautiful Victorian contraption that would n't look out of place in , say , 12 Monkeys . The Eloi of the 800k century look exactly as I would have pictured them , and the Morlocks are suitably creepy . < p > Much has been said for the special effects , which use some very effective stop-action photography . They are judiciously used here , and with only a couple of tiny exceptions , do a great job of suspending disbelief . < p > The DVD transfer is stunning , rivaling that of North by Northwest . The colors originally done using Metrocolor are deeply saturated and vivid , only looking slightly washed out in a couple of places . Artifacts from the original print are present here and there noticeably in the rotting fruit sequence , but for the most part have been well cleaned up . This certainly does n't look like a 40-year-old movie . < p > The DVD includes a documentary which is really interesting in parts , but really drags in others the special effects explanations are *exhaustive* , which is n't a problem since it has its own chapter stops . What 's really informative is to watch the original movie footage in the documentary and compare it to the restored footage in the movie itself . Night and day . Oh yeah , and Michael J . Fox and Carl Sagan make appearances ! < p > All in all , a classic movie that 's aged well , and a brilliant transfer to match .",m,1
"I always loved this movie since the first time I saw it when I was 6 years old . I remember taking a small toy car and sticking a little umbrella in the back to make it look like the Time Machine . < p > This DVD is really incredible ! What they did to the soundtrack is great . The movie sounds great in 5 . 1 and remember this movie is a 40 year old movie . FOX should have taken lessons before the did Planet of the Apes in 5 . 1 if you can call it that ! < p > Picture quality is superb . But I do agree with another reviewer that the DVD cover could have been better , but I do see that another BOX set version of this movie is coming out this month with alot more goodies !",m,1
"The 1960 film version of `` The Time Machine '' , was always one of my absolute favourites growing up and rewatching it now as an adult I appreciate now even more the great effort put in by the legendary George Pal and his talented cast and technical crew in bringing this story vividly to life . Their attention to detail , and creation of what are still awe inspiring special effects were of course created using their collective imaginations without the help of today 's computers . I 'm not going into exclamations as others have about the effects appearing `` dated '' , by today 's standards as that is a pointless exercise and really why is there a need to compare efforts such as this made in 1960 with the technology available to movie makers today ? I look at the film in the context of the time it was made in and in this way it can be seen that `` The Time Machine '' , was very state of the art entertainment upon its release . Using the excellent literary source in the famous novel by H . G . Wells , MGM studios in a last gasp of its famous move making finesse fashioned an exciting , thought provoking , and above all else spectacular story here that looks as fresh today as it did over 45 years ago . What is so totally impressive about this film version still for me is the marvellous depiction of the passage of time once the story gets under way and this progression by Rod Taylor on his time machine from New Years Eve 1899 through many thousands of years into Earth 's future is still one of the greatest science fiction sequences ever filmed in any decade . George Pal 's brilliance in visual design is wonderfully evident in every frame of these scenes where he shows the passing of time by the continual speeded up rising and setting of the sun and moon and best of all by a wonderful idea of continually showing the clothes on a mannequin standing in a neighboring shop window continually changing as the fashions progress over many decades . The time machine itself is a wonderful piece of movie making design and in the decades since the film 's release has really taken on a whole life of its own as probably one of the most famous movie props ever created . For all sci fi film lovers like myself this wonderful piece of imaginative construction along with the whole classic movie to which it belongs has assumed an appropriately timeless quality and illustrates yet again the genius that was movie maker George Pal .",m,1
"In the 1960 's , when movie making was still an art form , master puppeteer , George Pal created what has been considered a true classic , The Time Machine . Selecting as his hero , the handsome , gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor , playing Herbert George Wells , the director accurately portrays the adventurous , but moody , Victorian as a gentleman , who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date , Pal launches Taylor into the future . Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons , Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi . Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena Yvette Mimieux and her people . During their brief time together , Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic paradise , it is not without dangers . In this future , it 's the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells ' time machine . Doomed to spend eternity in the future , Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby Alan Young and his Victorian friends . The film is superb and despite being remade several times , has never been equaled . H . G . Wells would have approved . *****",m,1
"`` The Time Machine '' , is one of the many movies that when it was made was in danger of not living up to the expectations of many . There were those who love H . G . Wells and wanted an acurate portrayal of his work . There were those who liked science fiction and fantasy movies and wanted it to fit into that segment of cinema . It was going to be difficult to please everyone , but amazingly it did . The idea of using time travel in movies has been done and redone ; I think of the movies `` Back to the Future '' , `` Peggy Sue got Married '' , and many many more , but for me this is one of the better done ones , because1st . The movie talks about searching for a greater good . It 's not just a story of humor , or vaneness , or someone trying to get out of trouble . In other words , there is much more at stake in this movie . It 's a movie about one man searching for answers that are bigger than himself . I can totally relate to this . Let me be honest and say this is a thinking mans movie . Yes , you can just simply watch and enjoy , but if that is all you do you have missed out on so much . We are meant to watch this movie , and then meditate on it . To see ourselves in the characters . 2nd . the director could have made this movie in a number of ways , but the direction is superb , and I loved the special effects . The scenes when the inventor is still in his lab watching the first half of the 20th century go by is great ! I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette on the movie that is presented by Rod Taylor . The part of what happened to the actual machine after the movie is both interesting and sad . This movie is leaps and bounds better than the newer version of `` The Time Machine '' . Do n't miss this jewel .",m,1
A good movie for it 's time and a good movie now . So much better than the cheesy remake .,m,1
For old time classic sci-fi it does n't get any better than this . I remember watching this film as a boy and it 's still great even now . Please remember that the special effects are not as sophisticated as they are today but the story line and characters are great . An added bonus is that the digitally enhanced version for DVD is `` OUTSTANDING '' ! This picture is as crisp and clear as it gets and is hard to believe the film itself was made in 1960 . The special bonus features are also equally excellent with a few of the original stars of the film appearing some 30 years later with some neat surprises about the film . If you like science fiction than this film is a `` Must Have '' .,m,1
"Well , I think that this was probably the only movie I ever watched as a junior high and high school student . At least it seemed this way . And I was addicted to the book -- reading it in the bathtub , etc . But that is a different review ! < p > My only copy was a static-ladened VCR tape I got off of the local UHF . It was absolutely stunning to see the film in a clear letter-boy , plus to see the missing scenes that were cut out due to time constraints . Wonderful ! < p > Yes the effects are cheesy , and WWIII in 1966 is dated , but still . . . give it a break . & quot ; 1984 & quot ; was off , but we still read the book ! < p > This DVD has the complete film , and it is a good transfer , except for one or two scenes which seem a little fuzzy . The sound is tops ! < p > The great bonus was the & quot ; Making of . . . & quot ; This segment is a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie , with a special segment ! Rod Taylor George and Alan Young Filby filmed an addendum to the film , and it is an almost perfect continuation and conclusion to the film ! < p > This was the first DVD I ever owned . I love it ! Just the thought of traveling thorough time appeals to me . that is probably why I am a historian !",m,1
"The first thing I have to say about the film is that it tries to follow the book up to a point . But in order to make a film for the big screen they had to add just a detail here and there and , of course , a love interest . With actors like Rod Taylor , Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux in a film by George Pal you really ca n't go wrong . Actions , adventure , special effects ! The extra is a long feature mostly focused on the Time Machine , how it was made and what happened to it during and after the film . A must for any fan of H . G . Wells and sci-fi .",m,1
"Back in the mid 1960 's we were given a glimpse into the future courtesy of George Pal . The oscar winning film still manages to stir the imaginaion after all these years . For fans of the movie it doesnt get better than this . The film transfer is shown in its theatrical widescreen version and is digitally mastered from the original print . Included is a making of documentary hosted by Rod Taylor and can also be heard in 5 . 1 surround sound . I would have given this DVD a 5 star rating had they included some deleted scenes , and possibly an isolated music score . Sure its no Terminator 2 as far as special effects , but as far as story goes it still manages to keep me wanting to go up to the attic and get out my legos and erector sets and build a time machine of my own .",m,1
"What a great movie . Rod Taylor Takes HG Well 's George the main charactor through time . He tries to find a better world . Yet as far as you can go things remain the same . The special effects for the 60 's was great . HG Wells was showing how he felt about society . Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks . Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book . This movie was charming , exciting and a true classic . See it .",m,1
A thousand times better than the recent remake . Do n't bother with that one . This is the definitive movie . I watched this with my 22 year old daughterwho is studying animation . She agreed with me that George Pal 's 1960 animationwas as good as anything in the new version . The story was far better presented . and the additional 30 minute special feature with brings Rod Taylor and Alan Youngback together again 30+ years later was far more enjoyable than most 'making of'features .,m,1
"I saw this as a boy and it permanently entered my imagination . If there was one wish that I could have had , it would have been to have a real machine like the one in the film . I added the film to my collection so that I could share it with my children . Watching it at this age , I must say that there is still magic to it . In particular , the sense of history passing so quickly , seeing where the path of man might lead . The scientist truly still captured my imagination - his inspiration , his wonder , his hopes , his regrets , his struggle against smaller minds . That part worked for me as it did in 1964 , when I first saw it . I also enjoyed his discovery and investigation of the Eloi , who to his horror had devolved into passive children living only in the present , using only present-tense verbs . Unfortunately , the part with the Morlocks appeared preposterous and crude to me , a kind of tack-on to the great first hour of the movie , to make it an action movie in its last 25 minutes . It is fun , of course , but there is nothing distinguished about it and the end resolution is way too pat . And my kids g14 & b10 . With the special effects nearly 50 years old , they were not impressed . They also did not get swept up in the themes the way I did , again with a mix of sophistication and impatience with the slower pace the Star Wars infection , I would call that . But we did discuss it , even if they laughed at it for the most part . The extras of my edition are also OK . Though the documentary has too much about the fate of the prop time machine , there is also a fictional vignette conclusion that is truly worth the price of admission . Warmly recommended . I guess I 'm dated in my kids ' eyes , but I am still a sucker for it and glad of it !",m,1
I have been searching for this very version of this title for quite a long time . I owe the newer version of this film & I find it to be a very Poor remake of a very great Classic movie .,m,1
"This time travelling tale is getting quite old , but is still fineentertainment that will stir the imagination . Saw this movie around 40years ago and even if some stuff is outdated , it still holds my attention .",m,1
"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid , and have watched it at least thirty times since , it had a great impact on my life . The special effects leave a little to be desired , compared to a 'modern ' flick , but it 's a classic that belongs in everyone 's movie library .",m,1
"I 'm one of the few aged souls who first saw this in a theatre when it was first released . But , I 've also seen it several times since on VHS . I 'm new to DVD so I can neither praise nor criticize the techno dis- or advantages of that new medium . < p > I 've read the H . G . Wells novella several times and , like most people , I guess , have occasional fantasies of time travel . Years after I 'd first seen the film , I had a minor criticism , that the novella had more `` socialist '' undertones . The Eloi and the Morlocks had parted special ways due to economic oppression , i . e . , the latter being imprisoned in mines and factories so long that they became a troglyditic , brutal , predatory species while the former were weak , meek , ignorant , and the prey of the Morlocks . The film depoliticized that to a degree . < p > In retrospect , that depoliticization forgive the long word may have been necessary for the movie market of the time . The anti-communist fervor still existed then . What 's more , to make the story more meaningful to the young viewers , the producers and screen writers may have left out that which seemed more appropriate to Wells ' time . < p > And there WAS politics , appropriate to the time . For instance , the air raid alarm went off and the Eloi went into a trance to march to the dinner tables of the Morlocks . In other words , the original meaning of that alarm had been lost after thousands of centuries of distortion . < p > The characters were adequate , though I still find it hard to see Rod Taylor as an Englishman . Other leading characters went on to roles such as the lead human character in `` Mr . Ed , `` and Giles French , the genial butler in `` Family Affair . `` In any event , the special effects were superbly done , the story well executed . I could criticize the simplistic romance of Yvette Mimieux 's character , but the rest of the story overshadowed that . And , as others have pointed out , there was a challenge to `` realism , `` what one would expect after 8000 centuries . But the `` li cense of the medium , `` and the points of the story make up for those weaknesses . Neither Wells nor the producers intended historical realism . < p > And one can not help but be amused by the futurist speculation , e . g . , a nuclear war beginning in 1966 . Again , that was a overwhelming fear in the year the film was made and seemed all too possible . < p > Because I 've so loved this film for the last 42 ! years , I asked my wife for the soundtrack and for the `` remake '' if that 's what it is from Amazon . com for Christmas . When I get them , perhaps I 'll add a couple more reviews on these pages . For now , I think this film is a classic , and I still recommend the novella .",m,1
"It 's about time ! No pun intended . I saw this on TV when I was less than 10 years old , and I never forgot it - the image of that Victorian design time machine with the revovling disk is burned into my head . Imagine my joy when I saw it being used as the time machine in Carl Sagan 's COSMOS TV series now *there's* another that deserves DVD treatment . George Pal outdoes himself , with an story that 's surprisingly faithtful to the spirit of the original Wells novel - with romance , adventure , and visions of the future thrown in , right down to a nuclear war in the 1980s and lava filling the streets . One of the best things about the DVD format is the behind the scenes features you can tag onto classic movies - sadly , not all movie releases do this . Where 's the commented versions of War of the Worlds , Forbidden Planet - and when can we get The Day The Earth Stood Still and When Worlds Collide ? Come on - there 's tons of us SF movie geeks out there . Feed us !",m,1
"In order for a science fiction movie to seem plausible , it needs more than special effects wizardry , evil villains , or even a handsome hero although all three do not hurt . It needs at its core , a hero who resonates with the audience , one in whom they can identify because he acts believably , if not heroically . In George Pal 's THE TIME MACHINE , the time traveller George Rod Taylor can put the audience at ease with a smile or gentlemanly act of gallantry and can in a flash revert to the traditional role of derring doer whenever a pretty damsel is in need . The recent 2002 version of this film with Guy Pearce in the title role has too much of special effects and not enough of the hero . George Pal wisely allows his time traveller not to play second banana to the then 1960 special effects that wowed the viewer without distracting him . George is a scientist who on the last day of the 19th century wishes to prove to his circle of doubting friends that time travel is not only possible but practicable . There is a charming scene in which he lectures to them on the fourth dimension , culminating with a mini-time machine model that takes a cigar to the future . This scene functions as a necessary segue to the larger model that will carry him to his unknown future . Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot have minor but significant roles in that they set the tone that this movie is more about the relationships between people than it is between man and novel technology . George zooms to the far future where he encounters a race of humans the Eloi who have degenerated morally into a blandly hedonistic group of blonde but not too adventuresome weaklings who are opposed by equally degenerate atavistic green-skinned Neanderthals who see the Eloi only as food . This division of humanity into opposite sides of the same Jekyll and Hyde persona forces George into an ugly choice : he must decide which race is the better carrier of its ancient lineage . This decision is not as obvious as it may seem on first glance . The Eloi look more human but lack the moral fiber to take a stand even on issues related to their survival . The Morlocks certainly are ugly enough to arouse repulsion , but they nevertheless possess the drive to succeed and the ability to propagate their species . An Eloi female Weena Yvette Mimieux helps George to decide in favor of the Eloi . Yet , part of the success for this movie is the subtext that though appearances of humans and even humanoids may vary through evolution , each grouping and subgrouping of species can not be judged on a broad cloth of value . It is to the individual member that imbues that species with its collective identity . The Eloi , for all their lack of purpose , fighting spirit , and drive to succeed , managed to win out over their more bestial competitors -- this time . But the ending leaves the viewer that this victory of surface humanity over surface inhumanity may not be assuring enough to convince George , the Eloi themselves or the viewer that such success will continue no matter how far into the future George may go .",m,1
Maybe it 's because I think of this version as the standard against which all other Time Machine movies must be compared . I just enjoy it . It was a great introduction to the idea of relativity for my 8th graders . They really got into it .,m,1
The Time Machine 1960 was an excellent five star movie produced by George Pal starring Rod Taylor . This old movie has held up pretty well with the passage of much time . I first saw it at the Loews Paradise in the Bronx back in 1960 . Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film . Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective . The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story .,m,1
"Boy , did a nice DVD transfer like this one not only make me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better , too , for some reason . I only acquired the DVD as a memento , so to speak . I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s : Yvettte Mimieux . She still looks great , too . Since time travel stories also fascinate me , my favorite part of the film is when `` George '' Rod Taylor is actually in his time machine and experiments with it , slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII . Then , he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack . Apparently , scare-mongers back in '60 thought that was a short-term likelihood . Anyway , when `` George '' H . G . Wells , the author of this story finally stops , in the year 200 , 000-something , the story loses some of its momentum . However , it 's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people . Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed . The message I got on this last look is that man is still man , meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good , and to put one 's faith totally in man is a mistake . It 's only going to lead to disappointments as `` George '' found out on each of his stops . Notice he never stopped during a peaceful , progressive period . Yet , `` George '' is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better . There 's always hope for a better world and people like George , with his idealism put to action , can make a difference . Overall , an entertaining and thought-provoking film .",m,1
"`` The Time Machine '' is as far as I 'm concerned George Pal 's best movie . Released in 1960 , it stars Rod Taylor as the time traveler `George ' . George is an inventor in 1899 . In an gathering of his friends , he demonstrates a scale model of what he says is a time machine . Except for his friend Filby played by a finely nuanced Alan Young those gathered do n't believe him . Unsuspected by all but Filby , George has built a full-scale model . After his guests leave , he 's off . . . . . . . The set design is brilliant . The time machine itself is the coolest thing made by genuine imitation Hollywood Victorian craftsman . A nice touch is the nameplate on the control panel . It says , `` Built by H . George Wells '' . The special effects were state-of-the-art for 1960 winning an Academy Award for best special effects . Even today , the effects fit neatly into the story . This is a mid-twentieth century cinematic interpretation of a nineteenth century novel . The David Duncan screenplay `updates ' the story brilliantly . While George Pal 's films have a well-deserved reputation for technical excellence , the acting has been uneven . That is not the case in this movie . Mr . Taylor is totally believable as the idealistic inventor searching for a better world . Yvette Mimieux is Weena , of the sheep-like Eloi who begins to think as result of meeting George . The DVD I have has an excellent documentary on the making of the film narrated by Mr . Taylor . If you interested in a great SF adventure movie , this one is essential to your collection .",m,1
"This is the book Sylvester McCoy is reading as 1996 's DOCTOR WHO -- -THE MOVIE begins .

"I was glad to find this version still available . I enjoyed this because with our technology expanding so rapidly in today 's world , time travel appears to not only be possible but probable ; maybe in another 100 years .

"If you thought `` Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla '' had to be the worst Sammy Petrillo movie , think again . In 2007 I said of Petrillo 's performance in that vastly better ! production `` . . . be advised that Sammy Petrillo may be the most annoying man in show business , `` and in retrospect that was generous . `` Keyholes are for Peeping '' features Petrillo in a dual role : he plays Stanley Bebble , nerdy newly-minted marriage counselor , and Mrs . Bebble , his mother . The obvious reason to see this would be because it was made by Doris `` Nude on the Moon '' Wishman , and after watching this disaster you will be pining for the moon dolls even the one in the disgusting brown outfit . I have certainly not seen her entire catalogue , but this almost certainly has to be Wishman 's worst I hope so , anyhow . This transfer of the film is horrendous , but I ca n't imagine it looked good right from the processor in 1972 . The lighting and locations are among the ugliest and most depressing I have ever seen note especially the early dream sequence , but the costumes and hair are even worse . Worst of all is the script and acting , which is a career low for all involved . Pacing is nonexistent , nobody has even remotely rational or realistic actions , and the best performance is from Cocoa Stahl , who is a dog . No really , she 's a canine . The story is pure Wishman , and finds Stanley as a marriage counselor who ca n't get his own life together with his fianc & eacute ; e Katie Kristen Steen , despite all the various plot distractions of the film . Even the interrupted vacuum cleaner scene , which is intended to be titillating , ca n't make this film fun . Nor can the worst and least suggestive shower scene I can ever recall seeing . Stanley hangs out a shingle and starts giving out business cards handwritten business cards typically captivate the highest paying customers , I hear . He has to overcome problems with Katie and his mother , and deal with Manuel Philip Stahl , the building superintendent of the New York dump who is also the peeper-in-chief . As an aside , I hope you like vaudeville music and slide whistles , because if you do , you will want to buy the soundtrack ; if you do n't you will want to invest in earplugs . The film is supposedly risqu & eacute ; and I imagine it would still get an `` R '' today , but believe me when I tell you there is nothing enjoyable about the tawdriness of this film . At all . A better title might have been `` Ugly People in Terrible Situations . `` Eventually Stanley gets two couples on the hook for group therapy , and after counseling Cocoa I 'm not kidding , the onscreen action turns positively oily , and the film devolves to a huge fracas where Katie and Manuel join in the maelstrom of physical and situation comedy that wraps up the movie in a totally predictable , yet offputtingly seedy way that will make you want to take a long shower cold is fine . `` Keyholes are for Peeping '' is an abomination , and the transfer is its equal . While Wishman was a true pioneer and had an unnatural ability to make oddly risqu & eacute ; films , everything about this film is poor , most significantly casting Sammy Petrillo in the lead : in `` Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla '' he comes across as an impoverished man 's imitation Jerry Lewis , here his long hair and need for some cosmetic dentistry especially unappealing in drag make this an absolute chore to watch . Mercifully it was his final role .",m,0
"Both Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in their perfomrances in this movie , though for Watanabe san it was mere rotuine for him since he has regularly played such roles in his native homeland of Japan . His skills as a Samurai in this movie shined brightly and I was also taken by his english speaking capability . Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his . After seeing other movies of his I was somewhat disappointed by his perfomrances . After purchasing a book about the making of this movie , it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations , costume design , history of the Samurai and other details . From reading this it not only shows that Tom Cruise put forth countless hours in preparing for this movie as an actor and at the same time displaying respect for the Japanese culture . < p > Special mention undoubtedly goes to both Koyuki and newcomer to me Hiroyuki Sanada . Though I have never seen Hiroyuki san myself while I was in Japan for the last eleven years , his performance fell nothing short of spectacular . As for Koyuki san , most of her roles in Japan have been those of Japanese dramas where she obvioulsy speaks her native tounge . In `` The Last Samurai '' she shows that she is able to gain your undivided attention not only by her beauty , but by her presence even if she does not have many speaking roles . < p > For those who do not understand the Japanese culture much at all , `` The Last Samurai '' can and will shed some light for you in not only understanding but appreciating the culture as well . < p > I intend not only to view this movie numerous times when I wish to view great perfomrances by these actors , but to also take me back to a country which I fell in love with while I was there .",m,1
"The last Samurai is a very good film that falls just short of being great . That should not take away from the fact that it is one of the year 's ten best films or that it contains one of the year 's better performances in the form of Ken Watanbe , whose portrayal of a loyal Samurai leader is amazing as he draws you in to his world and culture . You can see why Tom Cruise follows him into his ways . This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance . The only problem I have with this film is how self important it is . Even films of this magnitude should not tug so hard on the epic strings . We get the point that this is a big historical epic . No need to keep implying it . However , this film is still worthy of some awards and a good audience .",m,1
"This film seems to have been constructed around Cruise to polish his , some might say , fading star . He 's allowed to chew scenery and over-act with abandon in almost every scene . I did n't believe for a second he was an alcoholic . His screaming `` Sake '' throughout his withdrawl scene was so obnoxious , I really could n't believe it , and was actually embarrassed to watch it . When he gets beat down by the Samurai with the staff , I really could n't believe Zwick and co . would use the ole 'they ca n't beat this man down ' cliched faux character exposition posturing . Again , my embarrassment grew as the overbearing score swelled . And right , surely the kids of the fallen Samurai would just love ole 'whitey'- I mean , he only killed their dad . Did anyone think for a second our American Movie Hero would n't nab the widowed Samurai 's wife - made a widow at the hands of Cruise ? Please . I give this film 2 stars only for Ken Watanabe 's performance and some nice cinematography . If Zwick will be kissing anymore Hollywood star behind in his future films , I only hope he gives us advance warning so I can avoid those movies like the plague . And Tom , gee . . . I have no advice for you . I am simply still dumbfounded at your performance here . I am reminded of Jon Lovitz in that old SNL skit . `` Acting , Genius . . . Thank you ! ! ! ! ! ``",m,0
Great battle scenes never seen in this scale . Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb .,m,1
"Okay , first off I want to say that this was a great movie , great acting and directing , great battle scenes and beautiful Japanese scenery . Many people say this is Dances With Wolves , yes the plot is slightly the same , but I watched Dances With Wolves , I have almost never watched such a boring movie , If The Last Samurai is this , it is certainly a much less boring version . And many people complain about how Tom Cruise doesnt die at the end , well 'It was not his time ' as Katsumoto explained numerous times in the movie . And the reason the children and Taka fall in love with Tom is that they forgave him for killing their father husband , they beleived they where both warriors that did their duty on the field , and they certainly believed that their way of life was worth fighting for . I would think that the way of the samurai or Bushido was worth fighting for , especially back then . As Tom said 'What could be more necissary ? '",m,1
"This is , without a doubt , the most underrated movie of 2003 . This is Edward Zwick 's crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise 's best performance if he had n't been in `` Born on the 4th of July '' . I enjoyed `` Master and Commander '' but it is so 2nd rate to this . This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain , scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops , who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people the samurai , who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds . When his old American comrades come to bring down the samurai , he does all he can to defend them . It is similar to `` Dances with Wolves '' and `` Lawrence of Arabia '' in that it is about a depressed man who changes his ways . But I think that this movie is ultimately superior to them . Another thing , the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking , another reason to see this movie . This movie deserved the 10 oscar nominations `` Master & Commander '' recieved including best picture .",m,1
"For many western viewers , this may be the first `` samurai '' film that they have watched with only a vague and rudiamentary knowledge of who the samurai were , what they symbolized , and how they arose and declined in power . The more one knows about the samurai , the more `` phoney '' this film appears to be . Make no mistake , this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai . This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo . There 's an early scene in the movie `` SHOGUN '' where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai . I watched Kurosawa 's `` RAN '' before watching `` THE LAST SAMURAI '' in the cinema where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers . `` THE LAST SAMURAI '' looks good visually , but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise 's egotism and Hollywood 's cliches and obligatory plot devices such as the weak `` happy '' ending . Nonetheless , this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today 's technocratic Japan . By the way , Japan 's new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines . The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled . On the other hand , it 's a Hollywood film where it is too commercially risky to cast Tom Cruise as a German officer named `` Fritz '' who drowns his sorrows in shnapps instead of whisky .",m,0
"Last Samurai is no masterpiecebut technically it isthe visuals , the sound effects , the music . If you want to show off to your friends what a great hi-def system you got , purchase this movie . If you want a classic , but lord of the rings or gone with the wind instead .",f,1
"After picking up my HD DVD player I 've had troubles watching regular DVD movies . I had heard some good things about this movie but could n't pass it up once it was in high definition . The story is pretty good . This is the story of Captain Algren who has been sent to Japan in the late 1800 's in order to help them modernize the Japanese army as they go from fighting with swords and arrows to machine guns and cannons . After the `` modern '' Japanese army prematurely attacks the Samurai and lose horribly , Captain Algren is taken captive by the Samurai and introduced to their way of life and refusal to lay down the sword in the name of compliance . In time , Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life . The story is pretty good but what raises this up to the level of being outstanding is the high definition quality of the movie . It was fantastic , especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence . If you like Tom Cruise action movies , this is one to pick up especially in high definition whether it be Blu-Ray or HD DVD . The violence can be extremely graphic hey , this is war so if you are sensitive to that you may want to look for something else . Otherwise , the pacing of the movie is pretty good . It is n't an all out gore-fest . . . there is action and then it breaks and lets you relax and catch up a little bit and then goes back to action and so on and so forth .",m,1
"Tom Cruise 's character comes off as a man who has seen violence from the time the doctor slapped his butt . War does things to soldiers that nobody else can understand or comprehend . The music is impressive , especially before the large battle . I feel goosebumps everytime I watch it . From the Cruise Samurai entrance to the emperor receiving the sword . Go for it .",m,1
"Okay , so the plot is just Dances with Wolves set in Japan . I still thought it looked glorious and that Tom is becoming a fine actor and that Ken Watanabe was fantastic ! For the length of the film , you 're transported back in time 100 years and get a wonderful taste of the period . The sword fights are wonderful , especially one where Tom 's character is set upon by four samurai . Usually , a Hollywood film showing the hero fighting against multiple attackers looks extremely corny : with each one waiting his turn to charge . This one looked quite a bit more compelling . When we saw it in the theater there was an audible & quot ; Whoa ! & quot ; from the audience when it was over . < p > This is n't The Godfather , but if you get it for a trip back in time complete with lush costumes and thrilling swordplay , this is a great ride !",m,1
"The Last Samurai is a showcase for Tom Cruise and he does a credible job of portraying Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who is haunted by his role in the slaughter of native Americans at the Battle of Little Big Horn . He is hired to train the & quot ; modern & quot ; Japanese army in defense of Samurai warriors who persist in rebelling against modernization of the Japanese culture . Cruise warns that his troops are not ready for battle and his prediction proves to be correct when he is defeated and captured . He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways . They return him to his people , but he begins to see that nobility lies with the Samurai and not with those who are trying to modernize Japan . It is all quite simplistic and the characters are pretty much stereotyped . There are lots of battle scenes , but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer . There are tears shed , but they are all shed by the actors and not the viewers . This is an epic film which fails to be a great one .",f,0
"The story is about a man haunted by his past in being part of a massacre of an Indian tribe . He ca n't sleep quietly since he is punished by nightmares about how he was forced to be and participate in something he clearly saw as wrong but had no other choice . Simply put this character is another poor life destroyed by war . < p > He is hired by the Japanese to train the Imperial Army in the occidental ways at a time a week emperor allows his advisors to forget tradition an import the ways of `` more advanced civilizations '' . In the process , the man gets captured by the samurai and during this captivity he begins not only to learn about their ways and philosophy , but also has peace for the first time in many years . < p > The Costume Design is incredibly accurate and the cinematography is absolutely superb . The music by Hans Zimmer is just beautiful , like another Gladiator epic . This movie is for people who love those little details . The production is really ambitious and works to deliver an astonishing view . This DVD is really promising with features like the `` History vs . Hollywood : The Last Samurai History Channel Documentary '' If you like this kind of movie where characters find themselves with a simpler but deeper view of life and appreciate a superb production , then this movie is certainly going to give you a very good three hours .",m,1
"You may think I am joking but Honestly , I enjoyed this movie from start to finish . I have found so many movies so boring of late that I just doze off during the performance . This movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes . Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout .",m,1
Beautifully filmed with a plot that truly touches the heart . The cast chosen were oerfect and the theme was good . No regrets ! Wating for the DVD to be released . A sure buy thing . I wanted to go watch it the 3rd time .,m,1
"The Last Samurai : 8 out of 10 : I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations . The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable . The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene . Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life . And what a life . Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody . Like Robert Redford 's take on Montana in `` Legends of the Fall '' , every view is spectacular , every sunset is orange , every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best . You would n't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment . Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree . Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted . Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did . Yet the picture despite one or two faults works . The acting , with one exception is uniformly excellent . The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good . On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson . The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope . His strangely self effacing dialogue does n't help his cause , yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy . In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout . I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie .",m,1
"Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren , an American soldier who has become disillusioned with his life he starts to regret the fact that the only thing he is good at seems to be killing . He reluctantly accepts a position to train an army of Japanese transcripts to use Western fighting techniques to combat the Samurai . He is ultimately captured by the Samurai , who need him as a source of information about their enemy . < p > As a captive of the Samurai , Nathan learns the ways of the Samurai and their people , and eventually learns to respect their philosophy about honor and service .",m,1
"The Last Samurai is a great movie , good story , very entertaining . I 'd recommend seeing this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD if you have n't seen it yet . < p > This movie is not a study in phenomenology and existential philosophy , but a good movie that made tears come to my eyes and that does n't happen too often . < p > I thought this movie was better than the Lord of the Rings , though I 'd guess that that comes from actually reading the books .",m,1
"I 'm actually surprised how anyone can bash this film , although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why . The bashers : one , someone who hates Samurai , and knows obviously NOTHING of Bushido ! While the other who loves the term Gaikokujin , which is akin to foreigner for the none-Japanese literate , apparently this `` reviewer '' is upset and angry with his own bad luck with asian women and so decides to rant furiously against a great film . It 's not a `` cliched notion '' as he calls it . Captain Nathan Algren not only nearly saved her life , but is symbolic to the Zen Way . He killed her husband , and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film . < p > Now , with those two mixed up reviewers tossed out of the mix , I wish to present to you an objective opinion . < p > The movie was great . I loved it . My favorite film ever , and I can saw that is alot coming from me , as I am a very cultured viewer . That is not to say you might not like it , as much of the film is in Japanese , and you would need to be open-minded to embrace it as I have . I personally , went in skeptically . I do n't particularly like Tom Cruise 's last performances . In specific , Mission Impossible 2 , and all the other movies where it focuses solely on him . It 's different in this movie . Tom Cruise contains his ego , and gives other people surprisingly proportionate roles . He was a hardened battle veteran , but still the movie shows that it was not his skill , as another reviewer whined about , that was great , but his perserverance . < p > I do n't want to spoil the movie , so go watch it ! It 's my personal favorite ever , `` and that 's saying a lot '' *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers , watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this , and still this one tops it off . Purely magnificent . A work of art .",m,1
"This film is a must see ! ! ! Tom reaches deep down for the emotions expressed in this film . You feel every ounce of his anguish and regret for the terrible things he 's done in his war days . I agree with the critics something I rearely do . . . when they say this film is of epic porportions . . . . . This film moved me very deeply , but it also had a touch of humor here and there . . just enough . I ca n't wait until it 's released so I can see it again ! ! ! !",f,1
"I have loved this movie since it was first released and have the original DVD release which I have watched several times . Most all the reviews I see here are either for the Standard DVD and focus on the great story line and acting but not the quality of the DVD itself . Yes , Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and , yes , Ken Watanabe steals the show but let 's move on . So this one will focus on the Blu-ray DVD 's quality . Bought the Blu-ray version from Amazon and it was delivered post haste . When I first looked at the back cover information I was disappointed that the audio was Dolby Digital 5 . 1 rather than a lossless DTSHD 5 . 1 , almost thought of returning it before even watching but am glad I kept it . The video quality of the movie is fairly pristine with no artifacting , good details in the shadows and a sparkling clear transfer . While the audio quality is not the higher end DTSHD , never the less , the audio engineers did a fine job with the front and rear surrounds used subtly for action actually , during the battle scenes , the rears deserved more discreet use of the rear channels however , during the rainy scenes , of which there are many , the audio is evenly spread to all channels enveloping you in the rainstorm . The many extras on the single disc are from the 2004 standard release and there are only 2 deleted scenes that , to me , could have been included in an extended version . I wish more extended deleted scenes had been included . The supplied extras were all interesting and , as I said before , had seen them on the original release so nothing new on that front . Should you buy this on Blu-ray ? Yes , the video quality is definitely superior , however , not by that much . The original release was pretty darn good . However , if you do n't already have the Standard version , go for the Blu Ray . I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film . Hopefully , this review has been of help and , if so , please check the 'Helpful ' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you . Thanks .",m,1
"The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren Cruise , a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai , and Samurai leader Katsumoto Watanabe , who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly . Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai , but after spending a number of months as their captive , subsequently finds peace in their way of life . Eventually , he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against . Not only is the plot interesting and original , but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing . Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort , which I consider his best ever . Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto , commanding even more attention than Cruise , and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles . Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka , Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio , and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham . The execution of the battle scenes was excellent . This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts . As seen in the extras , the progression of Cruise 's skills with a sword is n't staged , either . Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision . Having seen this film a dozen times , I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing , either . The ones I have noticed are hidden well , and none of them take away from the film in any way . There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable , but overall the script is very well written . Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes , and he does it well . What really makes the movie , on top of everything else , is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer . Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little , this one is unique and powerful . The Last Samurai 's historical accuracy is n't as poor as some reviewers would suggest , but it is a work of fiction . On the special edition of this DVD , 2 deleted scenes are included , along with `` the filming of '' one of the scenes , and `` the filming of '' the Cruise beheading scene . There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan . All in all , The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film . The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars , and it has become one of my all time favorite movies .",m,1
"When I watch a movie that I enjoy , I 'll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath . If I can find more depth and meaning each time , I consider it more than just a film , it becomes a teaching about life . Such is my finding for this exceptional movie . It offers up a wide variety of important , even vital , lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved . The writing , directing , acting , locations , depth of meaning are all most excellent ! In today 's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life . A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment . The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life , honor , purpose , self sacrifice , and pure , love . While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time , I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece . I suggest to the viewer , that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine . The point is to take your time with this film , sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it 's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions , and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also , what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of `` life in every breath . ``",m,1
"This movie succeeds in its primary objective : it entertains . There is a solid story here that engages the viewer , moves at a smart pace , and never drags . Nor is this a shallow shoot-'em-up . There is a fascinating overarching theme here : the transformation of Japan into a modern , industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society , i . e . the Samurai , will not easily fit into the new order of things . While this film has historical inaccuracies , it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration , which is what this film is about . The Japanese are portrayed respectfully , and I think accurately , in this film . The sets and scenery , by the way , in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie , and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV as I did . Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film , and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years . In my opinion , however , Ken Wantanabe , as the main Japanese protagonist , dominates every scene he was in , leaving the viewer wishing for more . I have noticed this about Cruise and other big-star films -- the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene . Nothing against Cruise , but a little less would have been more , because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent , and I would have liked to have seen more of them . Overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once . RJB .",m,1
My favorite element of this movie is Tom Cruise as modern man finding Solace in the ancient ways of Japan . It is a powerful analogy which explores what it means to be succesful in society and what it means to be a modern man . Something I often wonder about while thinking of my legacy .,m,1
"There 's something about Zen and Samurai that I enjoy . Oh yeah ! They kick butt in this movie ! Tom Cruise is a very crappy actor these days but I think this has been his best performance in a long time . He plays a Union soldier who slaughtered Native Americans and has flashbacks of the war with the Indians . Well , he 's asked to go to Japan and help train Japnese soldiers to erase their history of the Samurai , and in again Tom Cruise is faced with the same situation as the weak Japanese military he 's helping to create has a mission to wipe the Samurai at the request of the emperor . The story is simple . Tom Cruise goes to battle with the soldiers he has trained who have n't had really much training , kills a Samurai in battle , gets captured , is held hostage , and his captors treat him as a guest in their village . He is nursed back to health after a battle wound by the family of the man he killed and he goes through several flashbacks of the battles with Native Americans he seems to wonder if it was the right thing or not . He conquers his alcohol addiction and learns the way of the Samurai warrior . This tale is very touching because of the Zen way of life the Samurai have . He killed one of their own , and then is accepted as one of them and fights along side of them to prove themselves worthy of their honor . I still ca n't believe it was Tom Cruise in this movie , if only he could do more similar things to The Last Samurai .",m,1
"Don & # 8217 ; t have to say much here . This is an action film in the no-tongue-in-check , classic sense , of films like & # 8220 ; In the Line of Fire , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Rob Roy , & # 8221 ; and so on , a true action film . Absolutely worth watching and owning . It is one of Cruise & # 8217 ; s best performances . I just wish there were more films like this . Empowering . -- Michael Erlewine , Founder of the All-Movie Guide allmovie . com",m,1
"This movie , was incredible , simply put . Such a mix of romance and honor , all beautifully blended together . Tom Cruise does a WONDERFUL job in this film , playing a troubled man who took part in killing innocent indian tribes , who takes a job in Japan training japanese soldiers who would be trained to supress rebel forces led by Samurai Katsumoto , who believed that Japan was progressing into modern culturization too fast , and resisted political advisors that were urging the Emperor to do just that , become more western , and modern . Katsumoto 's tribe of Samurai defeat the unit led by Capt Algren Cruise and capture him . He is held in captivity with the Samurai , and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there . He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village , and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto . In the battle preceding his capture , Algren kills Samurai Horutoru , Katsumoto 's brother in law , and his caretaker Kata 's husband . During his time in this village , Kata is repulsed by Algren , troubled with the death of her husband . As cruise learns the ways of these people , and japanese , he gives his formal apology to Kata , who surprises him by replying that he did his duty , and so did her husband , and that the apology was accepted . As his status as a 'stray dog ' is gently brushed aside , he gradually becomes accepted . When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto , he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive . In the end , as a desperate attempt at saving the village in which Katsumoto 's ancestors had worked so hard to build and protecet , Katsumoto and Algren lead an army of Samurai warriors against the rebuilt japanese army . Witnessing this scene was so sad . A doomed attempt . Since Samurai refuse to bear firearms , they were vastly at a disadvantage , against the cannons and the new automatic turrets . As a final test of honor , the remaining samurai charge the army , only to be vicously mowed down in the heat of battle . In a final touching moment , Algren and Katsumoto , wounded , Katsumoto perhaps fatally , contemplate Katsumoto 's suicide in honor , only to end in the deed being done and Algren witnessing the utmost peace in death in honor . He Presents Katsumoto 's sword to the emperor , who realizes that he had been wrong to let his 'advisors ' lead him around too much , and that it was wrong to forget his honor . A simply AWE inspiring film , a must see , for anyone .",m,1
"For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster , The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter . My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor , disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good . In fact , though , the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth , the acting and pacing is excellent , and while there is some sentimental nonsense , it restrains itself more than most films do these days . The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography , the way that deaths of important characters are treated , and some of the images which arouse real pathos . < p > It 's still nothing spectacular , though - it never really risks saying anything that has n't been said before , or presenting some image which has n't been seen before - but it 's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience .",m,1
"While it may not be historically accurate and exact does anyone know of any film created in Hollywood that is ? I mean come on folks , it 's Hollywood . And I love Hollywood because mostly it 's all entertaining . The Last Samurai is entertaining and somewhat historically accurate , but the best thing about this movie to me is the underlying message . The one about Honor . Duty . Bushido and the Samurai way . If you 've ever wondered about the Samurai or heard about them but did n't quite & quot ; get it & quot ; , watch this movie . Then you will & quot ; get it & quot ; . The mind , the culture , the beauty of the Japanese Samurai mind . I saw this movie the same week that I saw the 3rd Lord of the Rings , and my first comment upon leaving the theater was , & quot ; Wow that was 10 times better than the Lord of the Rings & quot ; . For me it was and it is . Enjoy .",m,1
"This film has been compared a lot to Dances with Wolves due to the fact that they both share similar themes . A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it . < p > However , Edward Zwick 's film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character , Lt . Nathan Algren Cruise is down on his luck , having become a drunken caricature of his former self , deeply regretful of his actions , who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai . < p > As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they 're not ready for it . As a result , the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai . During that battle , Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors , getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto , the last great Samurai leader , who orders him captured and brought to his son 's village as a prisoner . < p > Once there , Algren 's life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people . They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be . After spending winter with them , Algren `` changes sides '' and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor 's army . < p > The title of the movie tells the final outcome . The Samurai lose the battle . Progress triumphs over tradition . New over old . But Algren 's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai . < p > The true worth of this movie is its look . You can definetely see where the budget went other than Cruise 's salary . A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing . The costumes are simply amazing , especially the battle armors . The costume designer is Ngila Dickson , who also worked in Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings trilogy . < p > Also of notice are the battle scenes , which are breathtaking . Very violent , but not gratuitous , they serve the story very well . < p > As for the acting , Cruise does a fine job , and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award , but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe who was indeed nominated as Katsumoto . His presence demands attention . He is the center of every scene he 's in . Koyuki 's performance as Taka , Katsumoto 's sister and Algren 's love interest , should also be noticed .",m,1
"The poetic resonance of `` The Last Samurai '' makes it a unique and thoughtful epic where two warriors contrasted by culture are akin in honor . The modernization of Japan serves as the underlying for the collision of differences between Nathan Algren Tom Cruise and Katsumoto Ken Watanabe . Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever-changing world . < p > The second act of `` The Last Samurai '' is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle . All that is demolished by the third act . I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem . Instead , the last scene was not necessary , it was inconsistent with the tone of the movie , and it went against everything the development of the movie . By having the modernized Japanese army kneel for the samurais and having the Emperor suddenly dismiss the arms agreement with the U . S . and becoming tearful for the samurais , it has sugarcoated the entire film . The film was about the honor carried by the samurais and how it is slowly diminishing beneath Western influences . Then all of a sudden , as if to make the audience feel a little bit better , director Edward Zwick decides to make a happy ending where all the samurais died victorious . We already know that the samurais are the heroes who died for a cause , but to have the Emperor suddenly feel apologetic makes him and the movie appear as feeble . It lost its greatness after the second act . < p > -Please finish my review at www . filmwiseguy . funtigo . com",m,1
"THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie . The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle . Sadly , I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen : now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype . THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie , a story of men overcoming their personal demons , of the power of allegiance to ideals , of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor , of growth of the human spirit and soul . < p > 1876 , and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to & quot ; Westernize & quot ; the country , and the army in particular , to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai , a band of dedicated , gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness . The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden , alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley Tony Goldwyn . The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor 's spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto Ken Watanabe they are naturally beaten . Algren , through his native skills as a fighting man , is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka Koyuki of a man Algren had killed . Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren , his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren , Katsumoto , and Taka . The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors ' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values . < p > The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is ! But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise . They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn , Koyuki , Timothy Spall , etc . The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful , the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent , and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender . Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film . Give this one a try in your home and see that it is better than you 'd expected .",m,1
"The modern landscape of hollywood can leave many of us quite depressed with a great void within us . We yearn for movies of subtance . Movies that have some soul . . . movies that make you think and feel , all while keeping you entertained . The effects laden , poorly scripted , commericial marketing schemes that pass as movies these days leave me for one wondering what happeend to the days when movie making was an art and not a franchise . < p > But then , just as all hope seems lost along comes a movie like this to renew my faith in hollywood 's abillity to put together a masterpiece . < p > The Last Sammuri takes place in the late 19th century , as america is in the end of the Indian wars just after Custer 's defeat at little big horn . At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change . The new Emperor has begun to modernize the formerly feudal nation at lightning speeds . Thus the stage is set in this oriental land for war between the old ways and the new ways . A rebellion of Sammuri warriors , who reject many of the new western ways has begun . The Japanese are at this time seeking advisors from all over the world to aid in thier modernization , including seeking military advisors from america to help train , update and lead the imperial army . An American Captain Tom Cruise , a veteran of the indian wars , is hired towards this end - much thanks to the fact that he has experience fighting tribal leaders the movie draws on the similarities between the sammuri and native american warriors . But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri , and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways , finds his own salvation in thier cause . < p > The plot is n't very complicated , but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes . All the charcters in the movies are very well done , and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic especially the portrayal of Katsomoto , which was just a brilliant performance . < p > The last sammuri has a little of everything . This is a movie that you will feel . You 'll laugh , you 'll be inspired , you 'll be anxious , and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment . There 's martial arts , humor , sword fighting , ninjas , battles , love , philosophy , drama - you name it . The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over-done - there is much more . The movie feels almost poetic at times , and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done . Many gorgeous shots are in the movie . And , unlike many movies , the slower scenes do n't leave you yawning but are very well done . The music and audio too , was top notch , some of the best I 've seen in a while . < p > all in all this became one of my all time favorite movies the moment I saw it . Many of the ellements reminded me of a slightly less gritty version of brave heart . And while Im not sure about the historical accuracy of the plot , the film does an AMAZING job depicting the beauty of japanese culture and the fascinating ways of the sammuri . Context-wise , the film hit it right oin the nose in terms of accuracy and really got it 's points across all while being very entertaining . And while some people may feel it a bit slow-paced , I found every last moment of the last sammuri to be a pleasure . < p > I wouldnt hesitate to call this a masterpiece and the best film of the year .",m,1
"Have seen this pic in cinema here irelandthought it was pretty damn good cruise pulled off this one very well -only thing to disapoint was on battle field riding back to the samuri troops , think too many films of this nature are doing that braveheart battle scence , but overall that this was a pretty good film had me on edge of seat at timestroughly recomend to watch or buy . . . .",m,1
"As a man who loves Kurawowa and other films of this genre , when I saw Tom Cruise was making this , I thought , `` You have got to be kidding . . . . . . . `` Then I saw parts of his Oprah stint and said , `` Plllleeeease . `` < p > Once again I underestimated Tom . Sorry about that TC . < p > The film was magnificent . I would have to say it is Oscar worthy , but those dumbasses who do the judging do not know anything about foreign films . Crouching Tiger deserved best pic darn it ! ! ! ! < p > I can not believe The Last Samurai was not nominated for best picture .",m,1
"A solid war film with epic battle scenes . A bloodbath , however , with a penchant for excessive violence , this film seeks a portrayal of glory and honor through battle in the name of the Emperor . On an ancillary note : Cruise exercises considerable poetic license , but this is overshadowed by the sheer framework of the story itself -- the way it should be for historical narrative . < p > The Framing of the film . < p > As pointed out in the film , the term 'samurai ' means 'to serve ' and the eeking out of this fidelity to imperial principles is the backdrop for conflict to be settled in a massive bloodletting -- what we have here is an eclipsing of the times . Foreign influences invading and suffocating cultural heritage , advanced weaponry and commercialism strangling the Japanese economic and political powers . What frames this contest of arms vs . honor , of modern vs . tradition , is a mutiny of cultural identity that has turned the government in on its own people . A nation whose own traditions are left to the wayside in favor of a 'costume ' of foreign security . This is a country eating itself up -- a self-devouring nation ravaging itself and thereby allowing outsiders to ravage it further . This crisis of national identity -- the effect of `` wannabes '' donning the latest novelty fad and `` purists '' upholding a cultural epistemology -- divides the nation and sets the stage for an unforgettable clash of political ideology . < p > For those who enjoyed the `` Meiji patriotism '' of the samurai exhibited in The Last Samurai , I recommend Yukio Mishima 's classic novel , Runaway Horses , which chronicles the rise of leftist `` purist '' resentment towards invading influences that were growing rampant cancerous in the nation 's economic and political sectors during the modern era .",m,1
"You already have the story line , so I wo n't repeat that . This film shows Cruise 's maturation as a SERIOUS actor - finally ! ! The other performances are also fantastic ; the actors are obviously all serious , veteran actors . They should have an Academy Award for `` Best Casting '' ; and this film should have won it . The film is often graphic e . g . , the final battle scene ; but at other times extremely delicate , subtle and sublime e . g . , Cruise 's scenes with the wife and children of the man whom he killed in battle . Often not a word is said - but the eyes , body movements , and lighting speak to us in soft tones . The Japanese actress KOYUKI who plays `` Taka '' , widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor . Koyuki makes Sophie Marceau and Charlize Theron pale by comparison . This movie is a MUST !",m,1
"It has battle scenes yes ; it has maybe a political point of view , but what really moves about this movie is the marvelous portrayal of values we often forget about . The human side of the soldier interesting now that these are war times . And also the family , friendship , loyalty , adult children relationships Cruise and the little Japanese boy , superb ! and above all , love a pure and sustained vision of love . It also serves us to look at a different and needed vision of Japanese stereotypes as seen on classic American war movies . Wacht out for Ken Watanabe 's camera friendly expression ; he won an Oscar for it !",f,1
"Wow ! ! In his opening scene , when Tom Cruise fires his Winchester above the heads of the assembled host , he 's shooting a `` Rifleman 's Special . `` I suspect that only those who grew up watching Chuck Connors will see it , but there it is . A beautiful thing to behold . Meanwhile speaking of beholding . . . . , this is a first class movie . One of the all too rare `` blockbusters '' that transcends the cliche . The movie quite sensitively depicts both the clash of East and West and their reconciliation whilst ultimately telling the story of the End of Things , the destruction of a Way of Life . It is a one of those very rare not-to-be-missed movies .",m,1
"This movie being categorized as action , pretty much misrepresents what it 's about . Yes , it has action in it amazing battle scenes , however it 's central theme has to deal with honor , the loss of it , and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society . On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living , and on the other you have the Samurai , more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive . Now , some people say the title of this movie refers to Tom Cruise 's character , others including me say it refers to Watanabe 's character , Katsumoto , who loosely represents the real life Saigo Takamori , the real life samurai who was considered the actual & quot ; last samurai & quot ; . Some reviewers also describe Tom 's character , Algren , as the white man who swoops in to save the day . I say he was simply a bystander caught up in the events of history . It 's not impossible to believe that a white man can get involve with the samurai , since this idea is borrowed from actual history of a westerner who adopts the samurai way of life during the rise of the Shogunate . No matter who 's name is credited first though , it would n't be much of a movie without the cast . With that said , Ken Watanabe , Hiro Sanada , and Koyuki make this movie . No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work . However , it is obvious that his character takes a back seat to what is supposedly the secondary plot of the samurai . Frankly , this is n't Cruise 's movie , it simply has Cruise in it .",f,1
"I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise , but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change . Granted , Cruise is a good actor , but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality . Nevertheless , I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise 's best films , if not his best film ever , because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt . Nathan Algren ; Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines . These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality . < p > Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film . Even though Cruise 's performance is excellent , the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast . Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord , Katsumoto . On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura , and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities . In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai . Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular . In addition , the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization . At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture . Last but not least , the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal . As always , Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film . < p > My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much . It would have been nice if the other characters , Ujio , Taka , and Katsumoto , received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance . Slight criticism aside , this is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I would recommend to virtually anyone who asked .",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' is everything a movie should be - exciting , emotional , and involving . Though I would not go so far to say that it 's a masterpiece , it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003 , and without having seen the new `` Lord of the Rings '' , it 's definitely near the top of the list . It will no doubt draw comparison with `` Braveheart '' because of the epic battles and the emotional climax , but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other `` battle epics '' . < p > Tom Cruise who spent two years learning Japanese plays Nathan Algren , a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze . His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country . His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle . He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways , and growing fond of the discipline , skill , and tact that the Samurai display . Knowing of the Emperor 's motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace , he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds . < p > There are many subplots and characters , some predictable Hollywood fodder do you smell a love story cooking ? , but most are effective and necessary to the overall story . `` The Last Samurai '' is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout . As you can expect , many of the battles are long , drawn out , and very bloody . But the violence is never gratuitous , and it knows it 's limits . As far as performances go , Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable , and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them . What really deserves special mention is the cinematography , which captures Japans lush valleys , majestic temples , and overall aesthetic beauty . The battle choreography is also stellar , obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' is not a history lesson , so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions . What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level , which is exactly what we go to movies for .",m,1
"Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures `` Christmas gifts to the world , `` and `` The Last Samurai '' is staged just so : Much of it is handsome , magnificent and morally decent , yet the movie is full of itself , in both solemnity and faraway gaze . Edward Zwick 's latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status , and the director never quite gets enough of it , and certainly not from star Tom Cruise , in permanent furrowed brow . < p > Developed from an interesting story by John Logan , `` The Last Samurai '' concerns Capt . Nathan Algren Cruise , a drunk , disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a `` modernized '' Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais , whose `` bushido '' code of discipline has long defended the nation . The samurai are led by their last great fighter , Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , fight by sword and bow , and have the fealty of the people . The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura Masato Harada has the ear of the young emperor Shichinosuke Nakamura . < p > Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so ; until then , he leads charges against green Japanese troops . In one battle , pitched in the forest by fog light , he wounds Algren , captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy . The samurai village is beautifully realized ; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll `` Braveheart '' purposely create a utopia at high elevation . With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean , Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai 's widow beautiful , expressive Koyuki . < p > While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order , he speaks English , displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it . His philosophy is unbending , but his moods are n't . Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern , authoritarian titan , and , with a smile , steals most of the scenes away from Cruise , who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can . < p > Inevitably , Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack , setting the stage for Algren 's conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo , then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns , played out in the valley we 've seen from afar the entire movie . < p > Four-act films are rare , but Zwick does n't fight the built-in structure , uses it , in fact to cover all the political bases , punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort . The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa , while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola . The final battle is a close cousin to `` Braveheart '' and deserves to be mentioned with it . Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves , and betray no weaknesses . Zwick is a fabulous combat director , and considering the movie 's scope , deserves a mention during awards season . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be . It forces a romance between Algren and Taka , the widow , when there 's no time to develop it . It tacks on a needless , uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion . The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate , too , in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col . Bagley Tony Goldwyn , one of Algren 's former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids . Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie 's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines .",m,1
"I ca n't find the words to describe this truly amazing movie . I was not a huge fan of Tom Cruise , but since it looked like it would be pretty good from the preview , I decided I had to see it . This movie exceeded my expectations . Tom Cruise really surprised me and delivered such a wonderful performance in this movie . I feel that this movie was a gipped from being nominated for an Oscar . I thought for sure it would have been . If the Last Samuari had been nominated for an Oscar , and if , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King was n't in the running this year which truly deserved to win by the way , then I think that The Last Samuari should of been best picture of 2003 . I feel that some people have overlooked this movie , and I am not sure why . It is such a beautiful movie , full of emotion , and wonderful performances . This movie is a true masterpiece .",f,1
"This Movie by far is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life ! ! ! ! ! No kidding ! Its about damn time they came out with a movie like this ! I 'm surprised to see Tom Cruise in it for I had under estimated his acting abilities ! I give him as well as Ken Watanabe great props ! ! ! ! They are truly wonderful actors and now one of my most favorites . . . . . I cant tell you how great this movie was ! It moved me in sooooo many ways . . . Ways as in the movie having parts that were funny , a lot of actions parts , and the best of all the dramatic parts . . . I like seriously cried 3 times ! ! ! And I hav n't done sooo in a long time when watching a movie ! ! ! That just tells you how more powerful this movie is ! ! ! It takes you there with all the Japanese Samurais and gives you another perspective on that kind of people . . . . Leaving the movies had me at a higher respect and a new look at the Japanese culture ! for I give a lot of respect to them and what they 've done ! ! ! < p > This movie has been definitly life changing for me and I recommend it to Everyone ! ! ! ! !",m,1
"I had owned this dvd and watched it many times ! This is a cinematic spectacle with lush cinematography and action , as well as a fantastic storyline ! I wanted to watch it one day and could not find it ! I literally went right to amazon . com and ordered it and am happy I did . It definately makes my top 25 films of all time in a collection of over 7000 titles ! Go out and get this movie if you have not seen it . You 'll be glad you did ! Michael",m,1
This is one of the best action movies since interview with the vampire . Do n't know how anyone can rate it less than 5 stars . Great drama action . :,m,1
"I 'm not big on movies . This one is big . I do n't normally watch R movies . This one is R because of the realistic battle scenes . I was struck with character quality after character quality throughout the movie . By the end of it , my soul was ringing with words like , 'courage , valor , honor , dignity , purity , perfection ' . I have to say that I felt I was educated in Japanese history culture to a degree by this movie . I have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie . The battle scenes are 'glorious ' , and the shifts from normal speed to slo-mo are perfect . Sound also has some zoom effects that do n't distract , but add to the themes of this movie . It is a movie I will watch again sometime . Excellent movie . You should see it if you have n't yet . I think it will make you want to go to Japan it had that effect on me .",m,1
"This is a great movie to show in history classes . It 's a great tool of showing how Japan was `` westernized . `` The no need for Samurai , the American training of Japanese troops , cannons , guns , the awful machine gun . Even Western style clothing , electricity , and modernization of mostly everything . And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived . Not only is this a great teaching tool but it 's great entertainment . It 's not that bad of a movie . There 's a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself . This movie has actually sparked my interest in the Japanese history . I do believe this movie does open your eyes a little to of pre-modern Japan and the changes Emporer Meiji made . It 's a good buy .",f,1
"In a day of movies based solely on how much special effects they can pack in 2 hours , this is really a different movie . Yes , there are battles with blood spilled all over but this is accessory to the plot . The story is what appealed to me . The old Japan is lost and it is a shame . This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture . Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an amazing feat . Of course there is a touch of Hollywood but that 's ok . Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors . Ken Watanabe is simply brilliant .",m,1
"Many have seen this wonder of a movie . If you do n't have the DVD 2 disk version , then you are missing out on so much more . The first disc has the movie and right after that they have the full movie again but this time with the directors commentary on every aspect of the film as it plays . The second disk has special features including interviews with the actors and what I think is worth the price of the DVD by itself : The code of the Samurai . The meaning and essential core of Bushido - what has guided generations of Japanese - is exemplified in these writings . We , in America , living in an age of twisted values and dishonor - the Code of the Samurai is a necessary template for our youth . Ken Watanabe , along with the many Japanese actors , are supurb . The woman who plays Taka displays the epitomy of feminine beauty and grace . Warning to all men : She will steal your heart . Another especially notable scene is when Tom Cruise holds the 8 year old boy as he grieves for what he believes to be the last time he shall see the paternal figure that Tom Cruise had come to be for him - tears shall flow . It is very touchingly done - you can not help but feel the pain - for parents - your paternal and maternal instincts will emerge and highten . This movie - more than any I have seen - incorporates the Japanese spirit and what we in America must instill in our children if they are to have a chance against the selfish and hedonistic `` values '' and examples that inundate our media . Love , Courage , Loyalty and above all - Honor . . . . this movie is a shinning example . The quality of the essentials of movie making are already legendary in this movie . Buy it for the values that this movie so beautifully demonstrates .",m,1
"It 's really 90 100No , it 's no way near perfect b c Hollywood made this film . Why you 'd wannna buy it:1 . One of the best battle scenes ever at the Lord of the Rings Braveheart Glory level 2 . It 's an epic ; it 's something new-no gladiators american wars3 . Sad as HELL ! I 'm not gon na blow anything away yet4 . Superb performance by Wantanabe , Cruise-what can I say ? The guy can ACT ! Why some ppl . did n't like it:1 . VERY VERY inaccurate . Please do n't study for the World History China Japan test using details from this film . The Saurai are misrepresented as pure good guys and the Japanese govt . as pawns for the US . Not true ! 2 . Time inconsistency- samurai techniques that took years to master can now be done by Cruise in less than a year3 . First 15 minutes of the movie , a guy kicks Samurai [ . . . ] . Later , he ca n't even touch them in a practice fight ! Adrenaline ? Go figure . . . Overall-despite its flaws , it ranks # 9 in my Personal Favorites b c I 'm an epic lover the Lord of the Rings , Lawrence of Arabia , Braveheart , Gladiator , Glory , Spartacus , Patriot , etc . It has great costumes , excellent cinematography , solid acting with honorable mention to Wanatanbe , and is just a great movie .",m,1
"Good costumes , terrific and brutal battle scenes in a breath-taking sequence which often resembles `` Braveheart '' and a few hints of the samurai tradition , but the final result is rather mediocre , because the story itself has a weak historical foundation and little relation to reality . I can hardly imagne rebel samurais slaying so remorselessly their brethren who serve in the national Japanese Army , and 19th century was certainly not like the 16th century `` the golden age of Japan '' when the rival warlords were fighting each other in an endless series of savage but highly ritual battles . Edward Zwick 's work is a good `` modern '' action movie but certainly not a classic . The obvious lack of authenticity leaves the film with only 3 stars . It is no match for Kurosawa 's epic films .",m,0
"Do you imagine the awful scenes of what it meant the invassion of the German Panzers in Polland Sepember 1 1939 when the resistance fought ridden on horses ? Well , this was the impression i reminded on the last sequence of this film . The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture . The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns . He is an antihero a man committed with nothing except himself . He is a haughty man . A mercenary without scruples who accidentally will discover a new world and will receive a slap in the facewhen he discovers the ancient traditions of this warriors . The ideological conflict between the ancestral ways of life and the modernity tradition will become in the central nervous of the film . Ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film . Filmed as a Sumphony in four moments , retains its interest all along the film except the conclusion , its only fault . Do you really expect that the hero presence after the battle is necesary ? Do you imagine a hero being interviewed , and telling his old memories for instance ? Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ? This resolution final twists a wondeful film loaded with epic spirit . But if you miss this little detail you will be rewarded by far with this picture . Superb art direction and special effects .",m,1
"If you are in to movies like Spartacus , Braveheart and Gladiator , then this should be on your list of movies to check out . The Last Samurai is about a captain , played by Tom Cruise , from the US army in the late 1800s that is sent to Japan to train soldiers in the way of modern warfare . Tom Cruise 's character ends up getting captured by the enemy , who are a civilization of samurai warriors who have chosen to uphold the ancient traditions of Japan . Throughout the movie , there is a conflict of interest between the new and old traditions and it is interesting to see the ways of the samurai throughout the film . There are both small fights and epic battles , both of which are done very well and are very entertaining to watch . Through all of the culture , battles and story line is some amazing cinematography . On top of that , the acting was superb . The Last Samurai is very entertaining and interesting movie that is solid from start to finish and fits in nicely with any collection of epic style movies .",m,1
"I enjoyed the movie . The sets and scenary were beautiful . The acting was excellent . Tom Cruise created a complex character . The battle scenes were reminscent of Braveheart . The comparison to & quot ; Dancing with Wolves & quot ; is fairly accurate . Both movies argue the thesis that other cultures are inherently superior morally and spiritually to the spiritually bankrupt Western European United States culture . There was a lot of spurting blood . The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good . < p > The clash of cultures was interesting . I do not know enough about the history of this period to judge its historical accuracy . I know the broad strokes were true . The Japanese Emperor hired Civil War veterans to modernize his armies and the Emperor had to put down the Ronans because they refused to modernize . There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period . < p > My main gripe about the movie was the ending . The movie went on too long . I enjoyed the movie , but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth .",m,0
"I really enjoyed it . I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured , i still thought it was a very good film . I also bought the soundtrack-it was excellent .",f,1
"I can not say enough about this movie . A lot of people were turned off before they even saw it because Tom Cruise plays a samurai . I say their loss . This was a fantastic story about a man whose past haunts him . He plays an American soldier who is captured by the enemy whose culture he is supposed to be helping destroy and the experience changes his life forever . The story was fantastic , the scenery was gorgeous , the costumes were exquisite , the acting was phenomenal . This movie is definitely on my 10 best of 2004 .",f,1
"There 's a cast of thousands and millions of dollars invested in this epic and it will probably pay off for Hollywood . The theme is an inspiring one too . It 's set in the late 19th Century , where Tom Cruise , a veteran of the Civil War as well as some cruel Indian massacres , goes to Japan to train the Emperor 's army against the Samurai so that Japan can modernize . That 's an oversimplification of this politically correct story for which I have seen no claims of being historically accurate . < p > < p > Soon , Cruise is captured by the Samurai and , learns to respect them . Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans . There 's excellent cinematography of a Japan that no longer exists and well-orchestrated battle scenes that are spectacular and bloody . And , not surprising , I felt no emotion other than to marvel at the great costuming and special effects . < p > < p > This is the third film about Japan I 've seen in the last few weeks . Clearly , it is the weakest . It 's not that it 's not well done . It is . But it 's basically a genre film that cost big bucks . < p > < p > It 's fine escape fiction though . The sets are great . And you 'll be entertained . Mildly recommended .",f,1
"The dream : Katsumoto , a rebellion leader whose only interest was to obtain a free Japan . he beleived that Japan should be governed by Japanese cultures and ideologies than Western . In my opinion , this movie opened my eyes showing me that culture is very important in our society because it protects and prevails our natural rights . `` I 'm not critizing others who emphasize more on the characters than the moral and cultural message of the movie '' . In the same way , this movie was presented as a historical `` tale '' , where protectors samuraies waere considered protectors and regulators of the Japanese Empire . I gave this movie 5 thumbs up becuase it reflects what Japan was , is and will be . By the way , the most interesting about this movie is that it does not contain sexual scenes most likely others . :",m,1
"Throw in a wolf and some blue face paint and that 's pretty much what you 've got : Dances with Wolves meets Braveheart . Civil war soldier thrown into the culture of his enemy mixed with a social class fighting for their right to exist . < p > Aside from the derivative nature of the movie and the music ; it was at times note for note The Thin Red Line , but they were both done by Hans Zimmer so at least in his case he was ripping himself , it was actually a pretty good film . Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far , partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop . < p > The message of the film is a very positive one , that of honor and courage , even in the face of unbeatable odds , a code almost completely foreign to the average American . Even with this , it 's a still a somewhat depressing film , watching the demise of an ancient and majestic society , which was traded in for the pop culture of the West . < p > At times the action was a little overwhelming for this type of film . At one point there was an attack from ninjas that almost degenerated into Kill Bill Vol . 1 - a little too much ninja for the epic journey film maybe . The last criticism is a technical one - while the cinematography was wonderful , the sets were not . There are times , mostly at the beginning when we see shots of San Francisco , and then a distance shot of Mt . Fuji , that it looks less real than a Bob Ross painting . I really would n't have expected this from such a high budget film .",m,1

"In THE LAST SAMURAI , Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren , a self loathing , alcoholic , Civil War vet just fired from giving demonstrations of Winchester rifles . A former comrade Billy Connolly gets him a job training the new Japanese Army to fight against the samurai , who are rebelling against moderization . Algren is captured by the samurai and becomes an ally of Katsumoto Ken Wantanabe , the samurai leader . I 'm not a huge Cruise fan , but I do think this is one of his better performances . He seems to have a knack for displaying self-disgust MAGNOLIA and he taps into it here . The film 's first act is its strongest part . Cruise is believably decrepit , and the opening battle , where the samurai swoop down on the frightened Japanese soldiers , is haunting . Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together . In the film 's middle section , Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai . This seems to consist of walking around , meditating , and practicing swordfighting . Cruise and Wantanabe have several metaphysical conversations , and Wantanabe performs with wonderful wit and economy , but nothing happens for far too long . THE LAST SAMURAI is entertaining , if a bit bloated , and contains several superior action sequences .",m,0
"1876 in Japan , an American soldier named Nathan Algren Tom Cruise has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai . He does get captured by the Samurai leader Katsumoto Ken Watanabe while in battle as he is brought to their village , Nathan begins to learn the ways of their life and even becomes one of the people for 2 years as learns to switch sides to fight on their side for honor and love . An amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic `` Glory '' Edward Zwick is one of the decade 's best pictures . Co-starring Tony Goldwyn , Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story . Although very similar to films like `` Man Named Horse '' , `` Dances with Wolves '' , `` Lawrence of Arabia '' or `` Last of the Mohicans '' this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia . The acting is flawless as is the direction , the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer 's score . This Blu-Ray offers quality picture in a great transfer that looks fresher and the sound is good as well and the extras include audio commentary , History Channel Documentary : Hollywood vs . History , 4 featurettes , deleted scenes , Japan premiere and trailer .",m,1
"Call it `` Dances with Asians '' or `` Japaneseheart , `` Edward Zwick 's `` The Last Samurai '' suffers from a near-fatal case of seen-it-before-itis . If the `` I have n't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet '' presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine , you 'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare . His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better , though even Ken Watanabe , who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity , is no Toshiro Mifune . Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan 's shallow script , which like most Western films about the East , implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped ; but for all of the posturing , there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash . Instead , viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films with corrected titles , as well as `` Gladiator '' and `` The Last of the Mohicans , `` not beaten this one to the punch . Zwick even plagiarizes his own film , the much better `` Glory , `` and fans of Hans Zimmer 's `` The Thin Red Line '' soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film . All in all , `` The Last Samurai '' is n't a bad film . With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity , such as ill-fitting uniforms , it 's also not bad to look at , even if some suspiciously modern looking powerlines turn up in one scene . It 's just that we 've seen most of it already .",m,0
"How come , when all the people get cut down in a full charge INTO a huge array of guns , Tom Cruise lives ? That 's crap . Anything to have a Hollywood , idiot ending , I guess . It 's a suicide charge , yet our guy goes back to his little darlin ' afterwards . What a load of crap ! Thanks .",m,0
"One of history 's great ironies is that the machine gun was designed with the goal of making war more humane . This is an expression of a reality that the makers of The Last Samurai seem to be highly aware of : that & quot ; progress & quot ; is a relative term , and technology brings as much woe as it does improvement . < p > At the film 's opening , ex-Civil War hero Capt . Nathan Algren Tom Cruise is a minion of the world of technology . Specifically , he works for the Winchester gun company , halfheartedly promoting the high-tech repeater rifle . One man in the crowd , noticing that Algren is clearly unfit to be a corporate performer , introduces him to Omura , a Japanese official visiting the United States . < p > In the end , he accepts a well-paying post as trainer for the Imperial Japanese army , which is engaged in keeping down a rebellion lead by Katsumoto played with genius by Ken Watanabe , former tutor to the Emperor and leader of a small band of samurai who reject the Western improvements which the Emperor is introducing to Japan . < p > Unfortunately , the Imperial regiment is sent out prematurely , and the samurai have no difficulty scattering it . Algren is captured and taken to a mountain hideout of the samurai , where he spends the winter as a prisoner . He is cared for by the widow Taka played by the arresting Koyuki -- why has n't Hollywood seen more of her ? and eventually is drawn into a series of penetrating conversations with Katsumoto . As time passes , director Zwick and his talented cast paint an absolutely enthralling picture of a society governed by discipline , tradition , and a sort of Zen stoicism that Algren begins to love . I am no student of Japanese culture , so whether this picture is in any way accurate , I do not know . I feel it is more important as iconography than as history , however . < p > Predictably , Algren throws in his hat with the samurai , learning Japanese and the expert use of the ever-important katana . But then , to his secret dismay , he is given safe conduct back to Tokyo and prepares to return home . But before the end he returns to the samurai village via some incredible swordplay , in time to take part in the final battle . And by the way , the scene wherein he is armed by Taka in her deceased husband 's armour , though completely chaste , is one of the most truthful and moving scenes of sensuality I have ever seen , largely due to the subtle and wordless acting of Koyuki . < p > Though the movie stars Cruise and , as many reviewers have pointed out , Watanabe ends up stealing the show , I think the underlying protagonist and antagonist of this film are cultures : on the one hand , the old , spiritual samurai culture -- i . e . the soul of Japan -- and on the other hand , the efforts at modernization spearheaded by Omura and funded by America . Since the sympathy is so clearly with the samurai , the film becomes a reactionary piece , perhaps even Luddite . Clearly , samurai culture was not all about discipline , poetry , and spiritual meditation , nor was America just a merchant nation happy to sell instruments of death for profit . But as I mentioned earlier , the iconography is much more important than the actual history ; the point here is that what we see as progress can often kill the soul and mutilate the body , and the ways and wisodm of those who came before us should not be rejected in favor of technology . < p > This is , after all , a classic theme with plenty of resonance , so it ends up working very well and not feeling too heavy-handed . And in the final battle , the iconography is emphasized to the point that it can not be missed : the machine-gun comes into the forefront as the incarnation of modernity at its deadliest . These scenes , with their slow-motion machine-gun fire and lack of sound or music , strangely reminded me of a completely displaced Road to Perdition . Here the cinematography becomes quite stunning , and the power of the symbolism is undeniable . < p > In the end , this is a classic tale of tradition fighting against the overwhelming tide of modernity . It correctly identifies the Good Life as something non-material , and then creates a drama out of men fighting and dying to preserve this life . Since the film portrays classic themes and boasts a cast able to bring the themes to life with a considerable degree of success , The Last Samurai rates five stars .",m,1
"Though set in Japan , `` The Last Samurai '' is an American film for American audiences . Through emotionally scarred American cavalry office Nathan Algren , we are introduced to Japan 's traditional and completely mythical samurai culture , supposedly threatened by the country 's 19th century industrialization . Traumatized by his role in the extermination of the Native Americans , Algren redeems himself by joining with surrogate Noble Savages , samurai warriors rebelling against the new modern Japan . As far as it went , the film was enjoyable enough -- elaborately choreographed action and stunning New Zealand landscapes . I need to remove one star for the painfully forced romance between Cruise and Koyuki . Another goes for the ludicrous liberties the film takes with history . Learning about the actual events after seeing this film , I was amazed by the way the filmmakers had completely and brazenly rewritten them . Their attitude goes beyond carelessness or artistic reinterpretation to downright contempt for reality . Essentially , `` The Last Samurai '' is pure fantasy that pretends to be historical . Of course , there 's nothing wrong with fantasy -- unless it tries to pass itself off as reality . In reality , the 25 , 000-strong rebel army fought with modern weapons and tactics . Indeed , their first actions were to raid government armories and steal as many guns and as much ammunition as they could , which did n't turn out to be enough . Zwick 's vision of sword-swinging , armor-wearing samurai is as absurd as having the Battle of Gettysburg fought out between lance-wielding knights in shining armor . It would look pretty cool but be impossible to take seriously . Perhaps this historical fantasy is the reason the film quite explicitly backs what was by any reasonable standard the wrong side in Japan 's struggle over modernization . It 's odd , is n't it , that a film from a country that takes such pride in freedom and democracy should glorify an oppressive , xenophobic , militaristic , medieval caste system and demonize the people and forces that brought Japan such modern plagues as as political equality and universal education . Indeed , Watanabe 's character was the first to call for Japan to invade Korea and expand its Empire onto the Asian mainland , and the government 's refusal to do so played a large part in his decision to join the rebels . `` The Last Samurai '' , although it pretends to be historical , does its best to avoid unpleasant historical reality by focusing on an idealized myth of samurai bravery , dedication and willingness to die for their traditional and fictional way of life . It does the same thing for premodern Japan as `` Gone with the Wind '' does for the slaveholding South -- invents an idyllic past and covers up all the unpleasant bits that might make one question the value of slavery or feudalism . An odd thought struck me while watching the final glorious kamikaze charge : are the heroes of this film so different from the reactionary extremists of the modern day ? Will Hollywood in a few decades be putting out a film celebrating the bravery , dedication and traditional virtues of , say , the Taliban ? I would have immediately dismissed such thoughts as absurd before seeing `` The Last Samurai '' . Now , however , I can not be so certain .",m,0
"After scanning some of the negative reviews posted here I must say I am shocked to learn that ANYONE could find this movie anything but exceptional . The words `` boring '' and `` tedious '' have no place desrcibing this exceptional film . It 's beautifully shot , wonderfully acted , full of humor , poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets , etc , I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie . My wife , who reluctantly attended the sneak preview , fell so in love with this film that she insists on seeing it again on Friday when it makes its full release . There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves , etc , but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner . You wo n't be disappointed .",m,1
"I wish that you could divide the rating system -- have one set of ratings for the story and another for the message . If this movie were about a fictional man from a fictional place learning about a different culture and finding a new sense of honor in himself , the movie would merit three stars based on the production values , the star power , and the entertainment value of exotic locales , battle scenes , redemption scenes , etc . the downsides -- the plot is predictable and there is no real depth to the characters But this movie disturbed me , perhaps because I had just read a history of Japan , and because it continued this Hollywood self-hatred of America theme that keeps rearing its ugly head . To view the movie , you would never know that Japan was struggling to overthrow a decadent and stifling shogunate that had basically kept the country back in the Middle Ages . Farmers were n't allowed to leave their villages . Samurai were n't allowed to go into business . Until Perry came , foreigners were restricted access to one trading post . While the backlash to Perry triggered a wave of ostrich-like denial of technology and the west , a very smart clique of leaders soon realized that the Japanese themselves had to take the lead in modernizing their country . The samurai who did n't get it , would have made their country more vulnerable to the west by being more backward , if they had had their way . So the ending is completely wrong , if you are pro-Japanese . Yes , they chafed under unequal trade treaties , but the future safety of the country was not to go backwards . . . and they did n't , so unlike China , the Japanese were able to recoup their sovereignty and engage the West on increasingly equal and if you were Russian in 1905 superior footing . The ending is also completely wrong if you are pro-American . The character played by Tom Cruise loathes his country as much as he loathes himself . Americans were not saints during the 1860s or in any era , but there were plenty of heroes , and it 's a tiresome choice to continue this stock theme of self-flagellation so rampant in movies like Dances with Wolves which this story really rips off -- I 'm sure that 's how they pitched it -- `` its Dances with Wolves , but set in Japan '' . I bet that the movie would have done much better if the Cruise character had been more noble in the U . S . and if the ending could have been about some kind of reconciliation , instead of the divisive travesty that they decided to show . At some point , one of the Hollywood studios is going to wake up and realize that Americans like to see positive , heroic portrayals from time to time instead of the diseased anti-heroes that they keep foisting on us , and whichever studio gets this will clean up at the box office . If you are into Japan see one of Kurosawa 's films . If you are into east-west stories , read Shogun or Tai-Pan . If it 's movie night , and you 've seen everything else , this will do for entertainment , but take it for a piece of fiction , do n't take its pretensions seriously .",m,0
"After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition , and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867 , things went very fast . Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA . But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais , and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent . This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais . This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA , an exclusive contract , and military counsellors . The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them . The film shows this very well . The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan . The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor , no real democracy , no concertation . Just change , and profits for a few . The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force . Japan needed new markets and new workers . They found them in Formosa , in China , in Manchuria , in Korea , and they even tried to conquer Siberia . We know what that process led to forty years later . We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles , and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation , and sooner or later the two come together . Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic . < p > Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",m,1
"I ca n't get enough of this movie . The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you . I ca n't get enough of this modern masterpice . Capt . Nathan Algren Cruise is an Army veteran . He 's become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he 's killed . He 's falling apart and things do n't look great for him until he 's offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura Hamada . The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly . The Emperors former advisor Katsumota Watanabe does n't like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them . He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people . Umura nows Japan ca n't beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto . Algren comes to Japan reluctantly . He hates Col . Bagley Goldwyn who is his superior officer in the operation . He 's trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can , but they do n't have a enough time . Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will . The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody . Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle . They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better . Algren is treated fairly well by the people . They help him overcome his alcholism battle . He hates the place at first , but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture . He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village . Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo . Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army . Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it 's obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor . Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto . After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army . The acting is phenomenal in this movie . Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto . Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity . He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically . He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination . This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back . Cruise almost did n't do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain . They did n't give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai . Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture . He is n't intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him . He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing . He 's funny , brave , charming , and smart all at the same time . He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it . I 'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie . This guy is great . Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie . The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this . Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume . He shots this movie well and it 's all done in tastes . The fight scenes are shot especially well . The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought . The violence is n't over done and you see the art that is sword play . Zwick has made a masterpiece . A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie . They think it 's sappy and to happy . It 's anything but that . If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren did n't fail his mission he has no shame . Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well . I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film . This is a great movie . It 's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details . This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do . If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film . If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up . You wo n't regret buying this one .",m,1
"& quot ; The Last Samurai & quot ; is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation . The battle scenes are created with great action and detail , as are the solo sword fights . And while the action is breathtaking , they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor , sacrifice and change . Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career , and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Katsumoto He was robbed at the Oscars . While I have n't yet had time to view the special features , none are really needed , for this film could stand on its own ! Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection ! Movie DVD Grade : A+",m,1
"I love this movie . There are few movies I can watch over and over . This would be one . I am a fan of Tom Cruise but not a fanatic fan . He is a very nice looking man and can act fairly well . But I do n't see any Oscars in his future . That being said , I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more . I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture , however , even if he were n't in the picture , it could have stood on its own . Ken Watanabe is a superb actor , not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto . Other actors of note include : Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio and might I add another hunk of burning love ; Shin Koyamada , who played Nobutada , Katsumto 's son and Tom Cruise 's first Japanese friend and Maisha Khan , who played Taka , Katsumto 's widowed sister and mother of two young boys and Tom Cruise 's love interest . As a little twist to the story , Tom had killed her husband in battle early in the movie , thus complicating her initial feelings for him . The movie is epic albeit predictable throughout and the ending is a semi-tearjerker . But that 's okay . You wo n't feel slighted and you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again despite knowing the ending . It is semi-family safe , no nudity that I can recall , maybe some mild curse words , but nothing that is over the top . I watched it with my family . But one word of caution : it is very , very violent . Decapitations , amputations , other bodily mutilations during the battle scenes ; these are samurai with very , very sharp swords and they used them very effectively . So remove all small children and those with queasy stomachs from the room before viewing .",f,1
"Set in Japan during the 1870s , Tom Cruise plays Capt . Nathan Algren , an American military leader hired to train Japan 's army in modern warfare . He is a drunk mercenary tortured by his inner demons . In his first encounter against the Samurai , Algren is captured by Katsumoto , played brilliantly by Ken Watanabe . He quickly is impressed by the Samurai 's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity . Ultimately , he finds himself at Katsumoto 's side , driven by his sense of honor . This is a great film and probably Tom Cruise 's best . It is beautifully written and acted . It is also loaded with brilliant cinematography and amazing battle choreography . An epic and worth mentioning with such great films like Gladiator and Braveheart ! A must own for any collector . NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS : A very nice transfer that enhances all the beauty of Japan 's landscape . The audio is slightly lacking but better than the previous dvd release . All the special features are carried over . FINAL VERDICT : IT WOULD BE DISHONORABLE NOT TO UPGRADE ! A MUST OWN !",m,1

"Set in 1870 's Japan , `The Last Samurai ' is the story Japan 's struggle to come to terms with the modern world whilst at the same time embracing its traditional past . Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good performance as the tormented Nathan Algren , a former captain of the US army who is having trouble with his conscience , unusual in a white man in the 19th century but he is haunted by his past , a past which saw him play a role in the slaughter of innocent Native American men , women and children in his own country . Algren eventually agrees to go to Japan to help train its soldiers in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation 's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the Samurai forces that are still clinging to the old ways . Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason , he does not care about anything or anyone , death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy , ' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai . Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle , ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train . He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka , the widow of the man he killed in battle , and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones . The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions . Eventually though Algren comes to realise he can not erase the past , he can either live with it or let it crush him . He chooses to live but only as a Samurai , and that could mean his death at any given moment . The whole film was a vibrant , violent , passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai . With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in , Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself . The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai , but I think it manages to find a kind of balance , with both good and bad on both sides , and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it . Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie , I liked that they used subtitles , it gave the movie considerable authenticity , and the fight scenes as gory as they were , were breathtaking to watch , along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I ca n't even do justice to in this critique . A movie I will be watching again I think , because you can not honestly take everything in , in just one viewing . By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion .",f,1
"To start off , this was a splendidly filmed movie with a fine sound track . After that , I do n't have much to say favorably . I 'm not an expert on early modern Japanese history , but as a journeyman I know enough to say with confidence that the story here is preposterous . The Japanese looked to Germany Prussia , not the US for army training . Emporer Meiji , the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler and was n't referred to as Meiji until after his death , just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa . The dramatizations and interplay of the characters , however , is what was really preposterous . It may make for decent drama , but this is the sort of film that leads to typical American ignorance about foreign countries and their histories . Anyone sincerely curious about this era in Japan might well read James Clavell 's imperfect , but vastly better , Gai Jin or , better yet , Lafcadio Hearn 's memoirs which point out that it was virtually impossible for a westerner to assimilate in late Nineteenth Century Japan . The producers of this film ought to be profoundly ashamed of themselves over this script which is nearly as bad as the despicably similar Bushido Blade of about 20 years ago . This does n't mean that one should n't see this , only that it ought not to be taken seriously .",m,0
"I really enjoyed this movie . Thank goodness , there was n't any unnecessary sex scenes which seem to be in most movies these days . This movie has action adventure and yet has at least one scene which has brought a tear to everyone I know that 's seen this movie . In a nutshell , this movie shows what respect is all about !",f,1
"& quot ; The Last Samurai & quot ; is the same story as & quot ; Dances with Wolves & quot ; - bitter Civil War vet goes off to a far away land and encounters a group of people looked down upon by Western Civ as & quot ; savages & quot ; but are instead a poetic and noble culture . The idea is nice , but overly simplifies feudal Japan , which was n't exactly a peaceful and idyllic place all of the time . The acting is good , the story is OK , but the ending is downright silly and unnecessary . I wo n't spoil it for those that have n't yet seen the movie , but let 's just say that the & quot ; true & quot ; ending would 've involved Tom Cruise meeting a noble death on the battlefield . Instead , he lives happily ever after , which was not the message of the rest of the movie .",m,0
"What we should appreciate before we get too deep into the odd story of Captain Algren is that he it is strikingly similar to John Blackthorne , the English pilot of a Dutch ship that ends up in Japan in Clavell 's near genius-like rendition of & quot ; Shogun . & quot ; < p > Without discrediting Tom Cruise who acted brillinatly I thought , the story does live up to general aspects of the & quot ; Shogun & quot ; tale but falls short in a few other areas . The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed , passionate , forbidden and conspiratorial . < p > Likewise , the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact , believable however it seems to happen swiftly . Too swiftly to remain completely credible . The script and Cruise 's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity , which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne . Well . Really seduces Blackthorne . But then again , it is Nathan that who becomes a true warrior , and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes . < p > All in all a nice ride , sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things ' genre and allow you to think . < p > Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting . Taka is wonderful ; the children are animated and innocent . The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again , seemed to add credibility . I should also mention that there are similar 'blood lines ' in the Indian Rights oriented & quot ; A Man Called Horse , & quot ; less interesting , less fulfilling , but possibly equally provacative . < p > Good job to all . 5 stars . Larry Scantlebury",m,1
"Comparing Samurai to Nazi 's is just plain stupid ! Should we compare the US army in the 1870 's to Nazi 's ? < p > Is this movie history ? I think so . Not because of the events as depicted in the movie , but for an attempt to capture a people 's values at some point of time . It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa 's epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes . We forget that the stories of King Arthur are very large fabrications of the West 's transition point to from the time of the ancients to middle ages , that the knights virtues in writing were pure but in reality they were brutal instead of kind . < p > That is the point of movies , to inspire and build up our view of humanity while being careful not to extoll to heavilly the villains . Tom Cruise 's redemption after massacring Indians is one point of the film . How he finds peace and honor is another . How a society of traditional values finds itself eclipsed by the modern values of greed are clearly evident themes in both modern Japan and the US whether it is true or not is not the point . Can something in the Samurai spirit of the film be used to inspire us ? Or must we only see this in films about hobbits and dwarfs partially inspired by the horrors that Tolkein saw in WWI ? < p > Technically the sword tactics were very well done and remain one of the few films that captures kenjutsu correctly . Cruise worked his tail off to make it credible and despite the time it would really would take to do so , it was still done well . < p > The filming in Japan was fantastic . The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well . The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured . The leader of the Samurai was also well liked by the common people then named a street after him shortly after he died may not be the exact historical replica of the man but most of the Samurai following were `` pissed '' at loosing their swords and topknots which represented critical parts of their heritage , not about attacking Korea . < p > So the question is . . . do we want a documentary or a movie to inspire us ?",m,1
"Remember that boring long mini series back in 1982 called Shogun ? ! Well . . . this movie is like that but better and shorter version ; less than three hours ! It 's only 154 minutes long to be exact ! Anyway , Tom Cruise delivers his finest performance as an ex-civil war hero who is hired to go to Japan and train the modern army against the samurais . However , during the first losing battle , he was captured and held as a prisoner at the camp filled with trained samurais . Then he falls in love with a wife of the slained warrior he killed during the first war in Japan . While he is living in the village as a `` slave '' ; he learns the culture of the samurai people . Then he learns how to fight like them as well . After he is released and returned back to the then modern day Tokyo , he is n't welcomed among friends because he wears the samurai clothes instead of civilian clothes of the 1860 's . Then Samurai General is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon . Tom rescues him from prison and escapes back to the village . They prepares for the war the following week . The final battle scene is amazing how sword bound samurais fighting rifle shooting Japanese army . And I will not tell you about the ending because you must buy this DVD ! It 's superb !",m,1
"This was a great movie not because of Tom Cruise . . . but because Ken Watanabe steals the movie . He is fantastic in this film and is an exceptional actor . He makes the movie worth watching . The scene at the end is beautifully played by Watanabe and a tearjerker . If it was n't for Cruise and his one dimensional acting , this movie could have been superb .",f,1
"Many of the reviewers liken this movie to `` Dances With Wolves '' but though there are some similiarites , the main difference is in the main character played by Tom Cruise . I 'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture -- in particular , bushido . Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I 'm not mistaken . Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick 's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography . If you can get this in Hi-Def HD-DVD or Blu-ray , I would recommend it particularly since the HD DVD price is below $ 10 ! !",m,1
"Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies , the cheap ending , the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass , and the negative liberal view of the white man 's legacy . All of these are valid points , but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades . One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history ; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores . For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai , Dances with Wolves , et al , I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance . Furthermore , this movie never claims to be based on facts , so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong . These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries . Somewhere in the middle lies reality . The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world , in a nation , and in a man . Troubled by his own violent past , Captain Algren Tom Cruise in his limited , grinning , wide-eyed fashion is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876 . The need for Cruise 's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself , but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience . The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography , the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own , powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast , an emotional score , and yes , the message , heavy-handed though it is . Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows , be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire , Jesse James or Wyatt Earp , Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it ca n't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license . Were it not morally reprehensible , they 'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis . . . . if they have n't already . There are n't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain . The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep .",m,1

"This movie is probably one of the best movies Tom Cruise has starred in as far as a storyline goes . While it may not be an action movie along the lines of the Mission Impossible series , it is a love story told against the backdrop of feudal Japan . The scenery is gorgeous and it actually has a plot to the story .",m,1
"Anyways , this product is amazing and the quality is superb , sorry I erased by mistake the rating but the reality is that from the transaction to the delivery was correct . ! ! !",m,1
"Perfect . Hans Zimmer is a true genius and he has composed here the best score of his career so far . The music transcend the movie and the landscapes are just to-die-for . I own both DVD and Bluray of this film to be able to play it whenever and wherever I want . True , it 's not so historical but never claimed to be . Sit back , relax and enjoy the ride offered by a perfect cast . Nothing to waste here , and that 's quite rare so I better mention it !",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' is an excellent film , respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story . The `` foreigner joins a warrior culture , taking on their strange dress and winning their respect '' story is well-represented on film and in history , from Bonnie Prince Charlie to `` Lawrence of Arabia '' and `` Dances with Wolves , `` as well as the Japanese-themed `` Shogun , `` which is based on the life of Miura Anjin William Adams . Here , Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land , and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture . < p > Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history , I was pleased by all aspects of `` The Last Samurai . `` Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented , although the Samurai come out looking much better . The warrior code of Bushido is not explained , and the lifestyle is completely romanticized , yet this is a movie and not a history text . Emperor Meji is well-played , which surprised me . He is neither hero nor villain . And there are ninjas , which improves every film . < p > In the vein of the big Hollywood epics , `` The Last Samurai '' serves up healthy doses of sweeping score , beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy . The country has rarely looked so beautiful , although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines . The samurai armor , while not historically accurate , looks beautiful on film . There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick . A great looking cast helps as well . < p > To this day , Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization , as can be seen in books such as `` Dogs and Demons . `` `` The Last Samurai '' has some good lessons for modern Japan , and some good entertainment for us all .",m,1
I do n't like Tom Cruise but this movie is great . The story is great,m,1
"I 'm not a big Tom Cruise fan , but I ca n't think of anyone else who could have done as well in this movie . The additional segments about the making of the movie , Japanese culture , and the Samurai were also very good .",m,1
"sometimes makes a good movie . The Last Samurai is . Historical ? Hardly . Take a few grains : yes , Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient , militaristic culture , a law unto themselves , & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie 1876 . Aside from that . . . Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars . He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force . Who is the enemy ? The Samurai , who are much admired & feared through-out Japan . They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life . In battle he is captured by the Samurai . Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe . He is impressed by Cruise 's fighting skills & spares him . Can you guess the rest ? Of course . It 's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate . While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle . Oh the pain , the inner conflict , the over-acting . I said it was a GOOD movie C+ . That 's it . The Samurai are doomed , destroyed by time more than anything else . Well done battle scenes . Lots of really good extras in this two disc set . Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave . He put a lot of time & effort into this movie . Lots of background & interviews with other principals . They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood ? about the movie & the `` history '' behind it . In some ways the extras are better than the movie .",m,0
"The year is 1876 , Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise has been hired by the Japanese in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern ' and less 'traditional ' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai . Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto Ken Watanabe who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai . This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack . Tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance . He discovered after his capture that the samurai are peaceful and as bad as they are made out to be , Cruise 's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust . Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka , however this is n't a main part of the film it shows that the film is n't all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film . The Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a triumphant in the movie industry . Thanks for it 's gripping storytelling , and excellent character design . By far Tom 's Cruise 's finest hour .",m,1
"Though I 'm not a huge fan of Cruise 's , his acting 's been getting better with age . The Last Samurai is a solid film that shows us cultural clashes between American ideals and Japanese philosophies in a truly enjoyable way . Definitely worth watching !",m,1
This is a movie that is based in ancient japan and shows you the real way of the samurai . It was a time when old japan was being destroyed and the new japan was being born . It gives you a better understanding about that time period in japan . It really was a big part of history for japan . It just a great film .,m,1
"This was a very important part of history that everyone should want to know , also important to see how the western civilization affected nations across the globe .",m,1
The video audio transfer has excellent quality like what I experienced from other WB blu-ray discs in addition to being an enjoyable movie .,m,1
"Wow . This movie deserves so many awards I ca n't even think of enough . This movie was the first movie to make me cry watching it . This movie had to be the most inspirational movie I have ever seen . If you have n't seen it yet , you have to see it . Gladiator almost got me into tears at the end , but this movie finally did it . If you liked Gladiator , you will love this movie , especially if you are interested in Oriental culture .",m,1
"I was kinda disappointed at `` The Last Samurai '' . I was attracted to the idea of an American soldier , as played by Tom Cruise , and a group of samurai . However , what I discovered was a carbon copy of other works by director Edward Zwick , plus a little `` Dances With Wolves '' on the side . Let 's see : Tom Cruise plays an outcast soldier who finds himself looking for redemption in the company of some samurai , who kidnap him while training some Japanese soldiers to fight against those samurai . This is like Matthew Broderick , who plays a soldier and finds redemption by training and commanding a group of African-Americans in `` Glory '' -Zwick 's best movie . Also , it 's similar to `` Legends Of The Fall '' , where Brad Pitt plays a desertor from the Army during WWI and finds redemption with a group of indians . So , in those Edward Zwick movies , we find outcast soldiers in Broderick , Pitt , and Cruise . Ah , and let 's not forget Kevin Costner , who also plays an outcast soldier who finds comfort with the Sioux in `` Dances With Wolves '' ; only Zwick did n't direct that movie , Costner did . However , not all in `` The Last Samurai '' is negative . I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR 's Ngila Dickson 's costumes ; the cinematography by , I think , by Caleb Deschanel is truly enchanting ; Ken Watanabe 's outstanding performance as samurai leader Katsumoto is electrifying and charming at the same time ; and , more importantly , Hans Zimmer 's eclectic and marvelous music score , which I consider a great guilty pleasure of mine . In the end , I do n't think `` The Last Samurai '' is a classic . I just wished Edward Zwick had taken a different approach on a film that promised too much .",m,0
"When it first came out , i had no interest as i felt after learning of the story , that while tom cruise is a good action film actor , he didnt possess the depth of skill to pull off a film of this nature . After catching pieces of it on cable , i decided to make an effort and watch it from beginning to end , and did so a second time . I then bought it and watched it again . I became immersed in it more deeply each time , realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing . From the strength of the superb supporting characters , to the gradual changing of cruise 's character , and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers , this was an excellent film of substance , not traditionally done by hollywood . While i have seen Dances with wolves , as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline , i feel that not to be completely accurate . I also feel cruise 's portrayal was more convincing than Costner 's , and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness . There are , like all films , weaknesses , such as the lack of exploration of the samurai 's rejection of modernity , a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this , and the dialogue can be a bit lacking , such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled , these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai . Watch it with an open mind , and scrutinize the background secondary characters , all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent . And imho , it was a better picture than Return of the king , but than again , hollywood picked Titanic over LA Confidential for best picture , so who said hollywood is a place for the intelligent ?",m,1
"This movie has it all . Drama , action , amazing battle scenes - the best I 've ever seen . It 's definitely a must see .",m,1
Lots of action . . . . lots of action . . . . and still lots of action ! ! Good movie with a great storyline ! ! ! Tom Cruise did a wonderful job in this movie . . . . just be warned . . . there are many scenes of blood and guts . . . :,m,1
"I enjoyed the film , and will watch it again . It certainly does have its limitations though . . . Insufficient character development , under-developed plot , and a fair amount of things that in perspective to the history and culture being treated are just plain silly . This film could have been so much more , but alas it seems the film makers just did n't have it in them to go beyond the ordinary and produce something truly special . The soundtrack was the usual sorry mediocrity put out by Zimmer . . to cut him some slack , it seems he works too much - how many films does he score in a year ? Ultimate conclusion : Somewhat enjoyable , but nothing more . And frankly with a few offensive elements which ironically were put in to make it more politically correct . . . P . S . Seems to me that certain someones may have been watching some Rurouni Kenshin before making this film . . . hmmm . . . .",m,0
"I always was interested in the idea and ideals of the Samurai , but no one movie can envelope as much as this one . Others , like Ghost Dog : The Way of the Samurai , tend to only cover the ideals but twist the images we all have with the word & quot ; Samurai & quot ; by urbanizing it or whatever . This movie is great all around , of course there are things that someone will complain about , but I am completely satisfied with this film . Every actor actress Cruise , Watanabe , etc . pull off each roll so believably , that you tend to either want or plain out give all your attention to this path that the Samurai take . The fighting is great because it shows the actually processes that original Samurai used to both follow , show , and perform in their everyday lives . Some of the images are straight out of a dream or a book about the Samurai . The areas are just gorgeous . The foreign actors , also bring a whole new respect to all others through this film . Overall this film is very emotional for some , but most of all , a tribute to the image and values of the Samurai . Hope you like it just as much as I did .",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' was a story about a man who changes the way that he feels about a certain type of people in Japan . It stars Tom Cruise , but to me he was not the star of the film . I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe . The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory . The entire movie could win many different awards , and I 'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated , because I have seen him in much better roles , like `` Minority Report , `` or `` Vanilla Sky . `` His great scene comes towards the end , where he gives emotion and power at once . < p > Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren , a Civil War hero who loves to drink . He 's recently come from battling American Indians in the west , and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles . But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army , with somebody that he knows Bagley . Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians . Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant . When they make it to Japan , they are met by the translator Simon Graham , and they begin to train the troops for battle . But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away , and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto . Algren is almost killed during the battle , but taken back to Katsumoto 's village , which is ruled by his son . Algren is trapped , and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan . While with Katsumoto , he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill . But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight . Algren befriends Katsumoto , and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought , and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' was a beautiful film . It had a beautiful sceney , beautiful action , some beautiful acting , and beautiful direction . I really did love it , and I am including it on the best of 2004 , only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year . This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre , otherwise it is not going to be an good . It is a big screen movie , and I have a feeling that I would have been disappointed if I saw it on video first . Try and see it now , before it totally disappears . < p > ENJOY ! < p > Rated R for strong violence and battle sequences .",m,1
"On seeing Edward Zwick 's `` The Last Sumurai '' , I had to deal with mixed feelings , good news and bad news . The good news : this is a big , beautiful movie relating an unusual story . In 1876 California an ex-Union officer Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise , who has battle scars both physical and psychic , is hired by Japanese diplomats to train an American-style army for the Emperor , conscripted against a renegade samurai Katsumoto Ken Watanabe . Katsumoto hates the Western ways increasingly threatening Japan . Katsumoto 's tragic story is not really that distant : it was only three decades ago that Yukio Mishima , frustrated in his attempt to protect Japan from the sterile corruption of Westernization , committed seppuku . Algren 's campaign to train the Emperor 's forces is not too successful when he orders them to hold fire , they do n't , and his first encounter with the rebel forces finds him a wounded prisoner . Algren is taken to Katsumoto 's mountain outpost and kept alive so that `` we may learn our enemy '' . One aspect of Japanese culture Algren is immediately obssessed with is sake ; but as his stay lengthens he becomes more attentive , learning the language , mastering kendo , and enjoying a Kyogen performance . In return , he attempts to teach baseball to the village boys ; but they seem to miss the concept , trying to catch the base runner instead of the ball . They 've come a long way . Cruise is an attractive actor , and this may be his best performance to date . Algren is introduced as a bitter , indeed a broken man ; but as his outlook becomes more philosophical there is a sincere depiction of a character desiring to understand the strange world around him . Cruise 's scenes with Watanabe , another charismatic actor , are the film 's most defining . Eventually , Algren takes sides with the samurai rebel , and when their Japanese forces face the Emperor 's Japanese forces on the battlefield , it must seem like d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu to the Civil War veteran , but this point is not belabored . The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll , as is the whole production . The world of mid-19th Century Japan is richly reproduced , and there 's even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco . The bad news : there is a major problem with `` The Last Samurai '' and it 's the ending . Why in the name of Chikamatsu did Zwick and his co-scenarists Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan , after creating such a sensitive and arresting story , mar it with such a weak conclusion ? All we need is a Henry Mancini coda . But , the ending notwithstanding , `` The Last Samurai '' , spectacular and intelligent , was one of the best movies of 2003 .",m,1
"What a rush ! This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time . I will not bother giving a synopses for the movie , but I will tell you what I loved . The movie has a great theme , that of a man seeking to atone for his sins . In the end , he finds the means to forgive himself through the help of another man , Kasamoto and his culture . Granted , there are several historial inaccurate items , but that does not stop this from being a great and enjoyable movie . < p > Tom Cruise name might get first billing for this movie , but Ken Watanabe steals the show as the honourable Kasamoto . He has rightly been honoured with a Academy Awards nomination . If anything , watch the movie for him !",m,1
"Would n't it be funny if a Japanese film crew made a film about a Japanese person who visited America during the Civil War , saw how honorable the black freedom fighters were and how violent and greedy the white people were , and in the end -- falls in love with the country , symbolized by his sexual conquest of American women , symbolized by a single female character in the whole film , who has to wear a corset and cook turkeys ? Let us call it something celebratory and romantic , like , The Last Confederate . I 'm sure Americans would flock to see this `` authentic '' film ! QUESTION : why is it that white people are so much more into samurai , death , and pride than people who live in japan today ?",m,0
"It is rare that movies with historical perspectives can capture all three sides of a conflict so accurately . As anyone who 's studied Japanese history can tell you , the conflict herein was almost perfectly portrayed on all levels ; within the government , within the characters , and within the nation Japan as a whole . Set in the 1890 's when Japan 's emperor Meiji was trying desperately to `` modernize '' read `` westernize '' Japan , we get to see an American 's perspective on the wars that are ravaging the old nation of Japan . While many Japanese people were trying so hard to be fashionable and up to date , there were a great many who felt that the country was being robbed of it 's heritage and the ideals that were so strongly ingrained in the people as a whole were being tossed to the side all in the name of `` catching up with the rest of the world . `` It 's tragic to watch as the young emperor is manipulated by his advisors into betraying the one man whom he should have listened to all along ; his former teacher and mentor Katsumoto . During all of this , however , Tom Cruise is thrown into the mix as Nathan Algren , a retired Civil War hero who won acclaim for himself for massacreing the plains indians in the Nazi-esque style of the time `` I was just following orders at the time , sir '' . Upon his arrival in Japan , his desperation for the sweet abyss of death is just out of reach time and again , but it is his capture by the `` enemy '' where he finds his redemption . < p > Some people who have reviewed this film refuse to see the Samurai as anything but bloodthirsty and savage much like too many people saw the Native Americans , which could n't be farther from the truth . A peaceful people by nature , but stoic and steadfast in their beliefs of honor and discipline two words that are unfortunately lost on most Americans these days , the Samurai sought only to keep their country pure from foreign influence a noble cause , if a bit misplaced and or closed-minded out of fear that their own way of life would go the way of the Indian which it did anyway , and herein lies the true power of this film . From the beginning of the film , anyone with any knowledge of Japanese history or even of modern Japan knows that the Samurai are ultimately doomed to die . I knew this going in , but found that this movie kindled a hope in me that they could ultimately win and save their country from itself as the samurai way saved Algren Tom Cruise from himself . While Algren succeeds , he and his cause ultimately fail and the emperor realizes this only too late as too much has already been set in motion due to the machinations of his scheming advisors who are only in it to line their own pockets which is totally historically accurate ; the merchant class saw in `` westernization '' a way to finally grow in social stature and the Samurai were standing in their way , so they used their newfound wealth and influence to eradicate the Samurai . Doomed from the beginning , this film is more about one man 's triumph over his own demons than it is about a country falling apart . Set against the backdrop of the Meiji `` restoration '' -era civil wars , there 's no way this film does n't succeed except , perhaps , for the romantic interest which was unecessary but not to the point that it detracted anything from the film . We root for the hero to overcome his own personal obstacles while watching him fight a losing battle against a place and time that ultimately implodes upon itself . And while he comes out on top , and stronger for it , he is now alone in his new world because those who got him to it have been slaughtered around him . All in all , the movie is tragic yet uplifting at the same time . It IS historically accurate no matter what anybody tells you , take it from someone who used to live in Japan and has studied Japanese history for 13 years , it is worth watching , and it was far more oscar-worthy than that abortion of a film about Japan `` Lost in Translation . ``",m,1
"This epic film demonstrates that the technical competency of modern American filmmakers is complete . But we already knew that , did n't we . However , in addition to technical virtuosity , there is undeniably artistic merit here . In my mind the most artistic and therefore most interesting scene in the film is when Algren Cruise disembarks at Yokohama . The lavish and loving care that obviously went into the creation of this time-piece set is impressive . One could watch this scene over and over again , seeking new details each time , and enjoy the pastime . Further artistic inspiration comes from the natural settings provided by New Zealand , and in particular the composite cone of volcano Taranaki , standing in admirably for Fujiyama . The geology of New Zealand is similar enough to Japan that this setting comes off very well in the story telling . Also , kudos to the carpenters and design team who created the structures ; this is really good stuff . Also in the positive column is the costumery , especially the Samurai armor . All visual aspects of this film are superb . And so is the story line ; there is much here to engage the imagination . This is withal a very good film , but with such elements described above going for it , it could have been a timeless classic of the filmmaker 's art . I acknowledge I may be far off the mark , but it seems to me these modern American filmmakers miss the mark time and again when it comes to where they ought to concentrate their efforts and imaginations , hence my accusation of this being a `` formulaic '' epic . These days a grandiose and expensively produced climactic battle is de rigueur , but why is this so ? Who decided this ? If you stop to think about it , is such extravagance necessary to tell this story ? In my opinion : no . Is it necessary to make this film a financial success ? Again , in my opinion : no . The short list of films I 've seen that have ripped my guts out with the intensity of their message have included not a single violent act , which is not to say some violence is never useful in telling a story , but it can almost always be suggested , instead of graphically portrayed . For me , these battle scenes are boring . I submit the correct formula for great story telling is to make such scenes brief interludes , then get back to the human drama , which hopefully will include some inspiring dialogue . At one point Algren muses : `` I am beset by the ironies of my life . `` Now here could be the beginning of something interesting , but this thought is not developed , and this nicely structured phrase is allowed to just drop . The heart of this story is the historical nexus of a medieval society attempting to catch up with the recently industrialized West , the dubious wisdom of doing so , and what might be left behind in so doing . The human drama inherent in such events is truly the stuff of epic tales . So why are these human dramas developed only briefly , and so much time and effort invested in fights and battles ? Clearly the producers think this is necessary for financial success . It is not clear they are right about this . Other formulaic elements seem intended to add depth to the story , but accomplish the reverse . We have the frontier cavalry as depraved and bad , and American Indians as noble and good . We have the hatred of the heroically defiant and rebellious member of the frontier cavalry whom we are prompted to love because he is so wise to be so rebellious ; an island of wisdom in a sea of decadence for his supposedly archetypal superior , with a result that will come as a complete surprise to all viewers who were born , so to speak , yesterday . I admit I 'm nitpicking here , but Taka , played by Koyuki , looks like the modern model she is . She is as lovely as can be , but an actress of her physical stature must surely have been selected to cater to modern tastes as decided by casting ; a more typically diminutive Japanese actress would have been more convincing . So , my recommendation is to watch this movie because it has very considerable merit , but my question is : who decided modern American moviegoers are primarily induced to pay money to see gory battle scenes and care little about complex human interaction ? I think they got it backwards , and do n't seem about to budge .",m,1
"I was very resistant to see this movie . As a man of minority I was not all that excited about seeing another movie that promotes `` whiteman 's burden '' . Why does Hollywood not trust people with color with our own stories ? The true story without the fictional character that Tom Cruise plays was just as intriguing . I must admit this was a good movie . It was cinematically lush and rich . The views , scenes , and camera shots were amazing and captures a spirit of Japan that is rarely seen . Hans Zimmer makes a emotionally captivating soundtrack . The costumes were well crafted period pieces . The actors gave commendable performances . I was most captivated by Ken Watanabe 's performance . His character was a beautiful balance of opposites . He was powerful yet serene , and a leader yet a servant , a rebel yet was dedicated to the emperor . This was a tumultuous time in Japan 's history in which tradition clashed with modernization . The tragic story would have been just as amazing without the fictional character that Cruise plays . I found it hard to believe that a soldier caught and held prisoner for one winter would be able to master swordsmanship to the point that he could stalemate a samurai who has been studying for all his life . Details like that disappoint me . Even in a story as epic as Last Samurai , there had to be a Caucasian meddling in the middle of it all . Loosely based on the life of Siago Takamori , the movie is overall a good film . My criticism is that the movie suggests that Cruise 's character is the Last Samurai . In a final scene the whole regiment of Japanese imperial soldiers bow down to a fallen Kastumoto . Algren holds the samurai , yet it appears that the whole of the troops are bowing to Algren ! I am disappointed that this story would not have been even told had there not been a Caucasian character to sell box office tickets .",m,1
"I loved the movie myself . Great camera work , nice action scenes , and alot of drama . I think many people would benefit from watching the old 70 's movie Shogun . I think Cruise did a fine job . Was he `` striving for an Oscar '' ? Do n't know . Do n't care . Why not let the movie and actors stand for themselves ? Does he have the same personality in all his movies ? Well , yah , sorta . But I 'm sorry so do most actors that people think are great . I love Anthony Hopkins myself , but he always seems the same . The only actor another that I love I can think of off the top of my head that is actually different in some of his movies is Gary Oldman and that 's stretching it a bit . I liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village . He saw them as savages , and they saw him the same way . The `` relationship '' with his hostess did n't seem strained to me . She hated him because he was an unwashed savage that killed her husband , but as time progressed , no one could deny his trying not only to fit in but to not back down which is something they would appreciate . And , he got on well with her kids . Call me chauvanistic here , but any man that is good with a woman 's kids will hit a soft spot . And , there was no `` Take me , Cruise ! ! ! `` scene at all in the movie . I do n't see the problem . Also , he never was samurai . He appreciated their culture but admittedly did n't understand alot of it which is . . . understandable . As to the final part of the movie being overly done hollywood . . . I think SOMEONE had to survive . Someone had to bring this to the emperor 's face and show it in a personal way . When you think about it , Algren was the only option for this . Was it cliche ' ? Sure . But , had it just ended with them all dying , there would have been no resolution . Perhaps had the emperor been there to see it . . . then I would say you could just leave it at all the men dying and the emperor being moved by it , but he was n't . So , someone had to bring this to him . It could n't be Katsumoto , because he and his sword was the message itself . It could n't have been the other samurai , because to do such a thing would have been not their place and disrespectful culture gaps here . The only person who could to this , and get away with it , was Algren . He was NOT a samurai and do n't be confused into thinking The Last Samurai '' referred to him , because it did n't . It referred to Katsumoto . , AND he represented a third party perspective . That was the clincher . The act moved an `` honorless white man '' culture gap again to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code . It WAS moving . And it was n't saying that by becoming `` modernized '' the Japanese were doing wrong as a reviewer put it . It was attempting to demonstrate and correct the attitude : the Western culture is better than ours and we must imitate them like a boy imitates his father . THAT 'S what Katsumoto was fighting against . You do n't have to sterilize your current culture to move forward . Recognize what you have and are and move forward with pride in those things . Do n't become a lapdog to cultures who see you as an oddity of backwards savages . Strive for mutual respect . Anyhow , I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving .",m,1
"In DANCES WITH WOLVES 1990 , Kevin Costner is the emotionally drained Civil War soldier whose life is renewed on the Great Plains by a wild wolf and a band of Sioux when he adopts the lifestyle and values of the latter . He & quot ; goes Indian & quot ; . < p > As this film opens in 1876 , ex-Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise , formerly of the 7th Cavalry , is an alcoholic Civil War and Plains Indian War veteran reduced to making public appearances on behalf of the Winchester Arms Company , maker of the famous repeating rifle . He 's rescued by his old commanding officer , Col . Benjamin Bagley Tony Goldwyn , who arranges for Algren to help train the Japanese Imperial Army in modern warfare techniques . The pay is $ 500 per month . Because of an incident in the campaign against the Indians that still causes Algren nightmares , cost him his self-perceived honor , and drove him to drink , Nathan tells his ex-CO that he 'll kill anyone in Japan for $ 500 a month , but would gladly kill Bagley for free . Army camaraderie is not all it 's cracked up to be . In any case , off both sail to Japan . < p > The Imperial government is bedeviled by rebel samurai warriors cranky about the increasing Westernization of society . In the first skirmish between Algren-trained troops and a samurai band led by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , Nathan is wounded and captured . He spends the winter in Katsumoto 's village , where he 's nursed back to health by Katsumoto 's sister , Taka Koyuki , whose husband Algren had killed in the recent battle . While a prisoner , Nathan discovers love with you-know-who and personal friendship with Katsumoto , whose life he saves at one point , and re-discovers Honor through proximity with and training in the Samurai Code . In the final confrontation between the samurai and Imperial troops led by Bagley , guess where Algren plants his standard ? It 's DANCES WITH WOLVES all over again , but without the wolf . The samurai even employ bows and arrows . < p > THE LAST SAMURAI is a well-acted , engaging story that 's shot in some beautiful scenery . Since New Zealand seems to be the location of moviemakers ' choice lately LOTR trilogy , PETER PAN , I was n't surprised to see in the ending credits that some of this film , presumably that part in the samurai village , was located there . And speaking of scenery , there 's Koyuki , a Japanese actress unknown on U . S . screens , who 's exquisite . < p > Unfortunately , the film is perhaps thirty minutes too long , and the climactic battle sequence is milked for all it 's worth - and then some - including some unnecessary slo-mo footage . The term & quot ; maudlin & quot ; comes to mind . And it 's this aspect of THE LAST SAMURAI which makes it , to me , inferior to that other action epic of 2003 , the more tightly edited MASTER AND COMMANDER . < p > THE LAST SAMURAI may win some Oscars , such as for cinematography or costuming . But , I perceive it as only one of the better films of 2003 as opposed to one of the best .",m,1
"When I saw this film at the theaters , I remember enjoying it but not thinking much of it . Now , years later , I watched it again , and I was so pleasantly surprised . The story is very dramatic , it 's beautifully photographed , and the action is breathtaking . The performances across the board are great , including what I consider a career best from Tom Cruise . It 's just really good . If you like historical dramas like Gladiator , Braveheart , or Dances with Wolves , you should really enjoy this . It 's definitely in the same league .",m,1
Not 100 % FACTUAL but a great movie with a wonderful view of changing cultural upheaval and the clash of traditional with technological,m,1

"I owned this movie before & it was stolen from my house . I was determined that I would not buy it again , but it was such a good movie I had to give in .

I am a high school student that is in love with the samurai . This movie after I saw it made me get back into the martial arts which I had quit over a decade earlier and now I am a assistant instructor . This movie is both historical correct on the sense of the last samurai killed himself . There was no Tom Cruise character but that was based on James Clavells Shogun . This movie is about a American veteran that has lost his will to live after some mishaps that he had when facing the american indians in the 1860 's . He gets recruited by the Japanese Shogun to train a modern army after Closed Door policy that had lasted for over two hundred years . The samurai are revolting because of the change and the Western nations changing Japan . Tom Cruise gets a new outlook on life when he meets the samurai and finds something he loves . This movie had me in tears b c of the history and emotion that was put into this movie . A must see film and a must buy film .,m,1
"This movie was a masterpiece . I felt it should have deserved more credit for what it received . One of Tom Cruise 's best performances of all-time . A GREAT story that was well told of a long forgotten group of warriors in Japan who fought and served with honor , excellence , and discipline with a purpose . Their duty lies in their name - Samurai=to serve . The most sophisticated warrior of its time . The scenes shot in the movie were picture perfect and awe-inspiring for admirers of Japanese culture and Japanese history . A story of West meets Far East . Tom Cruise 's ignorant , cocky , character from the West leads to a humbling experience when he learns to live with the Samurai and understand their way of life . He reveals that they were not a barbaric people but instead a sophisticated society that lived in discipline . Opposite of what the West had perceived of the Samurai image . I recommend anyone to this movie and if you didnt know it will open up a new perception of a people who lived long ago .",m,1
"After seeing all of the movies nominated for Best Picture 2003 , and just watching The Last Samurai last night , I feel that this movie not to mention its actors was greatly overlooked by the Academy . Cruise is spectacular as the disillusioned 7th Cavalry Captain who finds his place among Katsumoto 's Ken Watanabe . . who should have won an Oscar as well rebel band of samurai 's who are fighting to keep their tradition alive in a time when Japan is looking to become more westernized . This movie has a little bit of something in it for everyone and I highly recommend it . . .",f,1
"This film started out interesting and good , and then just became `` Top Gun '' . While interesting historically , this film lacked everything else , and just followed the basic `` Hollywood '' formula . It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise 's character a troubled , raging alcoholic could learn the art & skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time . The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun , just like `` Days of Thunder '' , and I was rolling my eyes towards the end . It sounds great on a home theater system , but this is'nt one I 'd want to buy & keep forever . Buy & own at your own risk , but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like `` The Seven Samuri '' .",m,0
"The Last Samurai is an inspiring , artistic , touching movie . It even manages to stay pretty close to the historical facts it 's based on . The premise of the movie is anything but new , even so , it 's a unique production . It offers insight into the japanese culture and we , the audience , take it in through the senses of the main character , Nathan Allgren [ Tom Cruise ] . We learn about the samurai , honor , trust , pursuit of perfection and harmony , discipline and tradition , all adjectives that make Japan what it is today . There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed . A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [ less gab , more shooting one might say ] . The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action . It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down-to-earth . Almost forgot to mention the movie 's soundtrack . Absolutely brilliant , the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music . Beautiful . All in all , I absolutely loved this movie and is now part of my DVD collection . It 's one of the few titles I would enjoy watching again once in a while .",m,1
"Ken Watanabe is amazing ! ! With his laconic & quot ; I like this Custer & quot ; he encapsulates everything that is both wonderful and horrible about the code of Bushido . < p > The cinematography is great , especially in all the battle scenes . The scene when the samurai charge through the mist at the conscripts , but at first all you see is their fearsome outlines , WOW ! The scenes in the village when the samurai are training , and later , when the young archer holds off the ambush , are also beautifully shot . < p > The attention to detail in the costuming is fantastic . Ngila Dickson definitely deserves her two Oscar nominations , and could have won for either Samurai or ROTK . < p > But Tom Cruise was completely the wrong choice for his character . He is such a modern icon that he simply can not play a period role . Everything about him looks , voice , movement stopped the movie dead in its tracks . < p > And some of the script was pretty lame , but this was the kind of movie you look at , not listen to . Subtitles over Hans Zimmer 's always-great soundtrack would n't have been a bad choice .",f,0
"wow , this movie was great . . . im serious , everyone should watch this movie . it was brilliant . It 's about Tom Cruise , he starts to train a Japanese army and then during a battle between his troop and the saumrai he killed a samurai and then he is taken prisoner with the samurai but they are kind to him and stuff . well eventually , he makes friends and what not with the samurai and he goes to battle on their side . i cryed so hard in so many parts of the movie . it was just so beautiful . and i laughed at some of tom 's lines . he really isnt such a bad actor nd this is by far his best movie yet . and the action scenes being a tru fan of patriot , braveheart , and saving private ryan were filmed really well . it 's true , this may not depicted what it was really like but i dont know why so many people are criticizing this movie . alot of people are saying its an insult to japanese to think that an american is the last samurai after a little while of learning . calm down ! my best friend is asain and she cryed and loved the movie ! it was not insulting to her nor her mother ! i wouldnt mindif americans were wiped out in battle and the only one left was an asain who adopted western ways . i 'd be proud that soeone survived and passed on the legacy of my people . that whole idea is a bunch of racist crap and stop overreacting ! ! ! ! i didnt think the movie was slow either . every part was beautiful and filled with depth and emotion . there was no way the editor could delete ANY scenes that were in the finished product because they were all necessary and lets face it . . . BRILLIANT ! and alot of people are saying the characters werent well developed but cant u see : their relationship with tom says a thousand words . alot of peolpe dont understand why the wife of the samurai that tom killed and tom slept together either . . . unromantic fools ! didnt u see the tension ! omgomgomg . . . their relationship was an element htat is inexplicable , yes . . . but still , its there and its beautifula and some things in life are better left alone and unexplained . . . in conclusion , may i say again : I LOVE THIS MOVIE . . . the dvd contains gr8 special features , too ! and anyone who thinks this movie is anything less of gr8 is an idiot who doesnt know a movie from a mojo . . . buy it buy it buy it ! ! ! ! ! NOW ! ! ! < p > anyone who loves historical movies , action movies , funny movies , dramas , or any kind of movie at all . . . this is a must have in ur collection !",f,1
"It 's unfortunate that some people dont see the true beauty of this film , like me if you are a anime fan you should see it . The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it 's almost unbelievable . Even though the story is fake the families involved and the events that make this story come to life are all historic facts . These men died in battle and even know they died they died to get their point across and to be heard when they needed to be heard the most . It was a fight that could n't be won but to these men it was either fight and die proud or run and you would be forced to kill yourself and die a coward , they died and the rest of their family lived to fight another day . Tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men samurai who made this movie great . To end this some peolple need to be told that before watching this movie dont mistake it for a fraud because some people expect Tom cruse to be the last samurai and seeing that he is not of japanese descent that might bother some people and it 's nothing like that because I judged this movie before seeing it and I was dead wrong and suprised at what saw and loved this movie .",m,1
"Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor 's forces in 1876-1877 . This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story . Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography , it 's bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script . Retired Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars . Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis Tony Goldwyn , Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan 's forces along the modern standards of 1875 . Arriving in Japan , Algren 's informed that the Emperor 's traditional samurai warriors and their leader Ken Watanabe oppose all attempts to modernize Japan . Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons , the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons . Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor , Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand . This was a good story that just never seemed to soar . This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue . Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode ? Although a film about samurai warriors , the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake . The dialogue is contrived and superficial : exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture . In conclusion , the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been . Here , a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film . The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script . For a true rendition of the samurai code and feudal Japan , I would recommend films by Akira Kurosawa instead such as 'Ran ' , 'Kagemusha ' , or 'The Seven Samurai . '",m,0
"I can not say enough good things about this movie so I will try to keep it short . Set in 19th century Japan a single group of samurai is all that is left of a once fearsome and noble tradition , and Tom Cruise ends up staying with them . I do not want to say much more about the story , unlike some other reviewers , because it is impossible to tell as well as the film does . I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan . Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal ! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far . Also , his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions . As for the fighting , there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed . Speaking of blood , the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent , they really bring the action to life . The anamorphic widescreen format is the icing on the cake . Packed with incredible fights and battles , breathtaking cinematography , and violence up the yin-yang I know that is chinese The Last Samurai is a must have for any movie fan !",m,1
"The degree to which I loved this film was really surprising . It is a film of epic proportions . The viewer is treated to a slice of historical fiction that , thanks to the second accompanying DVD , examines the degree the filmmakers qwent to guarantee the accuracy of the time period through the actors , the scenary , the costumes and more . This movie is about a used up war Captain down on his luck who gets the opportunity to make a good deal of money by selling what he has left to offer - that being his lifetime of warring , of making war and of studying war . He is perpetually haunted by the memories of his time serving under General Custer when he was ordered to murder innocent Native Americans , women and children , who he knew were innocent at the time they were slaughtered . He became an alcoholic . So the Captain is provided with this opportunity to go to Japan and train the newly developing Japanese army with the intention of defeating the old Samarai warriors who have been the protectors of the Japanese people for over 1000 years . The young Emperer is being pushed into the modern times . As a result , the Captain becomes exposed to the ways of the Samarai . The story is absolutely captivating . < p > Though I usualy do n't do this , I watched the accompanying DVD with the special features . I was glad I did because throughout the film I reflected back on what I saw and heard . During the first 15 minutes I did n't think I 'd like the film and I also had a hard time dealing with Tom Cruise as the Captain , but I knew shortly thereafter that I would be purchasing the movie on DVD . There 's just so much to see in this film and from so many different aspects that I want to be able to own and watch this movie whenever I 'd want as well as share and encourage my friends and family to see it as well .",f,1
"I enjoyed the Last Samurai . I wo n't pretend to be a professional cinema critic and , therefore , can not have an informed opinion about things like the cinematography , so I 'll mention in brief what I do know . < p > Positives : -Ken Watanabe delivers a phenomenal performance as Katsumoto . -Costume design is not only beautiful , but largely accurate . -Very entertaining as a whole , although people expecting a Braveheart level of action may be disappointed , as the battles are perforated with quieter moments of plot development and character insight . -Many small details were nailed down with pinpoint accuracy , such as the combat stances and strikes of the samurai , the differences in speaking proficiency and dialects used between age groups and social groups amongst the Japanese . -No gratuitous Taka nude scenes , geisha-esque stereotypes , etc . < p > Negatives : -Some portions of the script are needlessly saccharine although I fell for them and cried like a baby : naming it does n't make it ineffective . -The movie does drag at times , although I only noticed this after having seen it three or four times . -Tom Cruise , although he does a good job , constantly seems anachronistic , especially in contrast to other casting choices . -Returning to the saccharine point , the movie often seems to be caught up in its own power especially near the ending . -Some historical event inaccuracy , although the level of inaccuracy depends on whose accounts you 've read and believed . < p > Misc . Notes : -The title , & quot ; The Last Samurai , & quot ; is plural : do n't look for one man as & quot ; The Last Samurai , & quot ; as you 'll be disappointed . -Yes , yes , & quot ; Dances with Wolves & quot ; had the same basic premise , get over it .",m,1
"This movie is about the honor of a disappearing culture falling to the ever enchroaching imperial world in both 19th Century America and Europe . It is about the Samurai who are no longer needed in a Westernized Japan and symbolizes the culture of Japan as it is swallowed up by Western Imperialism in the 19th Century . < p > The movie centers around Captain Algren Tom Cruise , an ex-American Civil War soldier and Indian fighter who has lost his honor and is disillusioned about the world he lives in . Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet . Algren is sent to Japan by America to train the Imperial Japanese army in the way of Western warfare and weaponry . This sets up the confrontation between the Samurai , who are defending their dying culture , and Algren , who is trying to destroy that culture . Algren is captured by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , the Samurai leader , in the battle . While in capitivity , Algren learns the way of the Samurai and comes to respect the dying culture . < p > Many people say this is just a rip off of Kevin Costner 's Dances With Wolves . It is n't . This is a vastly different storyline with a similiar idea that can be seen in Dances With Wolves . The two are different stories . < p > The production values of this movie are great and well directed by Edward Zwick Glory . Definitely the a great directed movie . My hat is off to the crew that made this happen . < p > Yes , there are historical accuracies in the film , but besides Gods and Generals and Gettysburg , how many films are historical accurate ? Not many and if they were they would probably be rather boring to many . On this DVD is a documentary about the true story of the Last Samurai by the History Channel . So if you are worried about historical inaccuracies then you can get the real tale in the documentary on the special features disc . < p > All in all a great movie about a dying culture and how some people wo n't simple [ surrender ] themself to save their life and lose their culture .",m,1
"A very well crafted movie , with so many parallels to the spiritual life , especially the priesthood . I was particularly struck by its romantic view of an idealized lost culture , juxtaposed against modern industry and greedy politicians , which served as a warning against the dangers of Utilitarianism which pope John Paul II spent so much time speaking out against in his writings .",m,1

A samurai is an Asian Japanese knight . It was a decent action adventure flick . Worth renting once or twice . Tom Cruise 's fame does n't do much to heighten the film sceptic 's disbelief .

"Rolling in late December 2003 , this movie surprised me a great deal . I did n't know how deep it would try and be , or how good the storyline or action was . I may hear people complain about a few plot holes , but give the movie a break , guys . This is definitely one of Tom Cruise 's best outings . One of his most emotional performances is given here . Ken Watanabe is astounding as the leader of the samurai clan that take Civil War vet Capt . Nathan Aulgren Cruise into their clan as a P . O . V . but he eventually learns to like their culture and becomes a samurai himself . The landscape of the movie is beautiful , and Hans Zimmer 's score plays gloriously in the background . The movie really makes you eventually hate the & quot ; modern & quot ; enemy of a modernized Japan , with a fully-equipped legion of American-trained soldiers , Nathan 's old enemy from back home , and the leader of the new brand of soldiers . This leads to an all-out war between the samurai and the new Japan and it is an incredible scene when these two go at it , definitely one of my favorite movie war scenes of all-time . The DVD is a fully-loaded 2 disc-set , boasting impressive video quality and audio quality on the first one with 2 . 35:1 and Dolby Digital 5 . 1 soundtrack I would 've liked a DTS though , and impressive special features on the second disc that further immerse you in the world of old Japan . < p > Definitely a very powerful , albeit a bit fictitious , film . Spoiler coming up -- -- -- -- < p > we all know Tom Cruise died on the battlefield .",m,1
"This movie is a good one , but it could have been much better . If you go in expecting a period action piece , you will not be disappointed . Those expecting something along the line of `` Braveheart '' be warned . Tom Cruise is enjoyable , but he gives his standard performance . Which is to say that you do not see a character like he is capable of giving , such as Ron Kovic in `` Born on the 4th of July '' or even Lestat in `` Interview with the Vampire . `` Instead you get Tom Cruise as an angst-ridden , recovering alcoholic that looks great in a kimono . But the performance still works , it 's just shame about the missed potential . Ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist-turned-outlaw who tries to hold on to the outdated beliefs of the samurai . The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it 's one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film . As well as the much too short screen time of Billy Conelly and Tony Goldwyn . The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations . < p > Unfortunately this film buys into it 's own granduer , and it falls short on that level . There are some great moments in the film , do n't get me wrong . Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film . Even when you know what the outcome will be . But that 's where the film should have ended . Instead you get another ten minutes of an eye rolling , very sappy resolution . I 'm not sure if this was the product of Zwick or the suits at WB , but does not work . Another scene I found difficult to swallow was an assassination attempt . Great fight choreography , great action , but awkwardly placed and no justification for it . You can almost hear a studio exec say `` This is Japan . So where are the ninjas ? `` If the gunpowder obsessed emperor and cronies sent the assassins , which is whom you assume sent them why did they use ninjas instead of rifleman ? Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords . It 's because it makes for a great action scene , that 's why , and the audience will eat it up . < p > The film is good and I recommend it . But be warned that at times it comes across as very contrived . I was hoping for an epic , instead I got a really good action flick . Three stars instead four due to studio induced Oscar pandering",m,0
"I was surprised that I actually liked this one , particularly since it seemed to promise just another run-of-the-mill action adventure period piece . Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same . Still I did n't expect to enjoy this hybrid eastern-western that reworked Japanese history in order to put a dissolute and despondent American war hero who 's tortured by what he did in the Indian wars that followed on the Civil War into the era of Japanese modernization . Tom Cruise always seems to me to be too cuddly to play such roles and yet I thought he pulled this one off . The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute . That he takes to the Samurai lifestyle and weapons handling practices so readily is a bit hard to believe though the film does a good job of dragging out the learning process enough so that it does n't look too precipitous . Of course , the American is only with his captors for a few months so it 's a little hard to accept that he manages to become expert in Japanese swordsmanship in so short a span . But the film makes it look convincing and that 's usually enough in this kind of thing . The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord , Katsuomoto , who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed . Although there was little that was unexpected , Katsoumoto 's escape from his enemies at the emperor 's court was probably the high point and the least predictable in the film 's repertoire of scenes . I 'd see this one again for its ambience and tight storytelling , even if it did n't ultimately swallow me up , which , on my view , is the true measure of a great film .

"`` The Last Samarai '' is one of the greatest films released in 2003 , starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe . Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences ' eyes wide open through the whole movie . Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant . Despite the war themes , there are some great heartwarming scenes , namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles . As he begins learning Japanese traditions , he begins learning more about himself , which plays a crutial part in the film . As this develops , the drama also develops , which keeps audiences interested . This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was . His friends ' life stories add an additional unique flavor . The war scenes are uniquely intense . Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery . This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict . < p > Its Oscar-nominated 1870 's Japanese setting is flawless . They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set . The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects . The costumes are accurate from those times . Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film . < p > Tom Cruise 's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years . His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off . He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second . The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it . Ken Watanabe 's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight . This performance makes acting appear easy when it 's actually the opposite . He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years . All other actors also performed their roles beautifully . < p > '' The Last Samarai '' is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion . This is sure to please many audiences .

"This film is definately on the top of my favorite movie list . Tom Cruise does a beautiful job portraying a Civil War veteran that is having a lot of difficulty accepting what occured in his past . He goes to Japan for a job of training a modern Japanese army fighting the last of the samurai that are rebeling against the ways of the government , but still fighting for the emperor . He ends up becoming a part of the warriors he was training to kill , and so begins the epic tale of Nate Algren . A memorable line that the charecter Nathan Algren states at the beginning of the movie is this : You want me to kill Jappos , I 'll kill Jappos . Colonel Bagley : I 'm not asking you to kill anybody . Algren : & quot ; You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos , I 'll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos . . . Rebs , The Souix , The Cheyenne . . . For $ 500 a month I 'll kill whoever you want . But keep one thing in mind , I 'd gladly kill you for free . & quot ; Really makes you wan na hang around this guy , huh ? The acting is amazing , Ken Watanbe plays a cool headed philosopher type samurai that has interesting and touching ideas . This movie is definatly one that is worth seeing . For sure a five star movie .",f,1
"The Last Samurai does many things exactly right , but falls short in a few key respects . It 's a great action movie , and passable as a drama . That 's a shame , because it could have been great on both counts . The major problem with this movie is that the main character is played by Tom Cruise . This is n't because I think he 's a bad actor ; in fact , I think he does a pretty good job with his role in this film . However , a white man was totally unnecessary here -- this movie would have been much better off as a story dealing only with the Japanese . The assimilation that occurs here strains credulity , and certainly Ken Watanabe , in a sterling performance as Katsumoto , could have carried a film himself . The fact that the presence of Cruise is a necessary concession to the target audience makes it forgivable , but not likable . Things would have been better if Cruise 's character , Algren , were better explored by the film . Unfortunately , although Cruise does his best , the writers do n't seem to know what to do with Algren . Though his transformation is the heart of this story , we never really come to understand who Algren was at the beginning , and have only a vague idea of who he has become at the end . Even his journal entries , poorly narrated by Cruise , grant us little insight . We are merely left to take for granted that Algren would come to respect , rather than resent , his captors . Why Algren takes a more enlightened approach to other cultures than his American peers is also a mystery . This lack of insight into Algren should be contrasted with Katsumoto , whose motivations , though convoluted by modern standards , are fully explicated . In other respects , this film succeeds greatly , and masterfully avoids falling into most of the Hollywood traps . There 's no sex scene , no pointless explosions , and in many ways , no happy ending . The battle scenes are wonderfully shot , and the setting is excellently delineated . The emotional interplay between Cruise and his Japanese counterparts is good in most instances , though there are a few moments that falter . And Katsumoto 's final scene is powerful and moving , an excellent note on which to end a movie . Unfortunately , they did n't go straight from there to the film 's epilogue . Instead , they tacked on an additional scene with Algren and the emperor , in which the dialogue consisted almost entirely of cliches , and the young Emperor jarringly speaks in idiomatic American English . It 's crap , and it comes at the end of the movie , where it does the most damage . If you can convince yourself to forget that awful piece of filmmaking , however , The Last Samurai has some resonance , a moving story , and compelling characters . Katsumoto in particular is one of the most interesting characters to come onscreen in recent years , and I can not stress enough how well Ken Watanabe plays him . This movie is worth renting just to see his intense performance . If you 're a fan of samurai films in general , it 's probably worth a buy . It 's far from the quality of a Kurosawa epic , but The Last Samurai is a much better film than your average Hollywood blockbuster .",m,1
"I did not hear the best reviews of The Last Samurai when it came out . Many said it was a good film , but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve . My mother is not at all a Tom Cruise fan , so I did not hear much good about him either . Then my grandparents glowingly recommended the movie to my whole family , and we decided to watch it with them one night when they came over . What I had seen when it ended was a moving , excellent film which , if not perhaps an epic , is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation . As I said , this movie is perhaps not an epic on the scale of-The Lord of the Rings , for example . It does not contain quite the sweep and grand scale that the latter has in buckets . It is about honor , about discipline , and about a man from a completely different country who joins forces with the samurai . So no , I would not necessarily call it an epic , although it certainly contains some of the ingredients of one . Whether the director and screenwriters intended it to be , I do not know , but that certainly does not keep it from being one of the better films I have seen . The hero is Captain Nathan Algren , a Civil War veteran and soldier in the 7th Cavalry who fought in the Indian wars . At the beginning of the film , however , he is not employed in warfare , but in promoting the weapons of the Winchester arms company . He does not come out to perform in time , however , and he is fired . Another job comes his way , however , when his commander asks him to accept the offer of a certain Mr . Omura , a man highly ranked in the Japanese government who , in accordance with his and the Japanese emperor 's wishes to westernize his nation , is employing American soldiers to train the Japanese army . Algren agrees , although horrible memories of attacking innocent settlements in the Indian wars make him loathe his commander . Once in Japan , Algren assumes the responsibility of training the Japanese army , which consists mostly of peasants who have never even held guns . Then , before the army is fully trained , a samurai leader , Katsumoto , a man who thinks Japan is changing too quickly , continues the rebellion he had previously begun by attacking the railroad owned by the same Mr . Omura who hired Algren . Algren 's superiors insist on attacking , despite Algren maintaining that the troops are unready for combat . Despite superior firepower and numbers , the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle , and Algren is captured . But after several difficult months , he finds himself living among friends , not enemies . He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai , and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan 's future . The directing is certainly very good-Edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication . That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie . The sister of Katsumoto comes to love Algren during the course of his stay , and they actually remain chaste . Wow ! What a concept ! I am sick of having well-made movies filled with trash that renders it off-limits , and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex . A word of warning , though-it is fairly violent , and there is some swearing , so despite it 's good qualities I would n't recommend it for the younger children . The camera-work is also excellent , giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of . . . New Zealand . I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan , but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it , and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan . But I have never been there , so do n't take my word for it . The acting is good , and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films . Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto , and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto 's sister . But perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai . Honor , devotion to duty , discipline , and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here . I do n't think Western culture is being universally blasted here , but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters ; but that values and morals should be honored and practiced . Hollywood does not recognize that Jesus Christ is the only answer to life 's questions and that He is the reason that all these morals are held in such high esteem , but they are at least doing something better than their ordinary fare . Definitely recommended !",m,1
This is the best damn tom cruise ever . I forgot that was tom and believed he was capt . nathan algren . this movie is a masterpiece . forget that review above and watch this instant classic .,m,1
"This is my favorite non-trilogy movie RotK is actually my truly favorite , and while I respect anyone who loves this movie and gives it 5 stars , I must say that none of these reviews gives this movie any justice ! They tell you the basic story . . . an alcoholic Civil War guy . . . enemy . . . samurai ! While that is the story . . . there 's a lot more to it than that ! What captivated me and all my friends 17 - 21 years old was the Samurai . . . and , all the emotions of the story . . . an American kills the Red Samurai . . . who is the Samurai Captains Brother-in-law . . . he lives in the house and is cared for by the Red Samurai 's widow . . . Tom Cruise sees the beauty of the Samurai people and understands the honor and respect and culture and discipline of these people and realizes they are not the enemy ! He learns a lot from these people and earns their respect in many ways ! The widow . . . who knows Cruise killed her husband . . . offers the Red armor for Cruise to fight with Samurai against the Army Cruise was sent to train ! Beautiful movie in every way ! It is no way slow at any point ! When someone says this movie is `` slow '' , it simply means they do not feel the emotion of silence and music and the visuals they see ! The battles are a very small part in the greatness of this movie ! But , the end of the last battle will have you reaching for a hanky ! The Samurai are a beautiful people ! Also recommended are Samurai books and old classic Japanese Samurai movies ! . . . unless you think it 'll be . . . slow !",m,1
This is a Great Movie And i love it . The price for it is cheap so it is a Must Buy ! !,m,1
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAM OF THE OLD MEETS THE NEW AND EAST MEETS WEST . ALSO A GOOD EXAM OF THE MAIN CHARAXCTER DEALING WITH HIS OWN PROBLEMS .,m,1
I liked it . The ending was n't bad . A lot more of the movie was spoken in English than I was expecting . The swordfights are really realistic and graphic . It 's something that Jackie Chan would n't have even been able to handle . There was a fairly decent number of parallels with Dances with Wolves .,m,1
"I ca n't stand Tom Cruise , but he sure was a hottie in this film . It 's amazing what long hair on a guy and losing the whole Scientology thing can do for a person . . . . Anway , 1 I agreed with the whole sad Native American slaughter tragedy-the fact that it was horrible and I ca n't believe people actually did that . 2 Loved the scenery in Japan 3 Still do n't ca n't relate to the whole Japanese obsession with `` honor '' that is actually pride Does n't the Bible say that pride goeth before a fall ? ? ? ? This movie was worth watching , but I would n't watch it again as it was way too sad . I can appreciate all the effort that went in to making this film",m,0
"This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves ! It 's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais ! ! Of course , this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves , more warfare , more cool fights and more blood ! ! ! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action , the story is a little predictable but still interesting . P . S : If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances , but basically they are the same . Adios .",m,1
Even with all the negative attention Cruise has been garnering lately it 's hard to see why people would n't see this film . The movie is romantic and fanciful . It is somewhat ridiculous and over the top but also elegant . The fighting scenes are dead on and actually quite beautiful . By far though the star of this movie is Ken Watanabe . If for no other reason you should see this movie just because Billy Connolly is in it .,m,1
"This movie is excellent in conveying a different and needed perspective about Japan at this period of history . Much can be learned . Unfortunately , I am reading reviews from people that wanted a typical Tom Cruise action movie . They were expecting a formula based on action , clever plot twists , and more action . This does not require an effort to understand the beauty of another culture . One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese , and therefore not acting . After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies , this one is a slice way above the rest . Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision . His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film . He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren . This chemistry was special throughout the film . This is a formula that includes real story telling , action , a demand to stretch your understanding , and more action . Therefore , the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad . I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie , and knowing it became a personal project . It does remind me of Kevin Costner and `` Dances with Wolves . `` I am sorry to see a less culturally open minded audience in 2004 , outside of the Japanese American communities .",m,1
One aspect I really like in this movie is it 's portrayal of PTSD in Cruise 's character . I recommend it to family members of returning war veterans .,m,1
Great performance of Tom cruise . . . I am not a big fan of him but I just love this movie .,m,1
"In short , great film to say the least and the music Hans Zimmer is excellent and blends perfectly with the movie .",m,1
"Imagine you are a woman living in the United States , and a foreign fighter Pick any of the convenient enemies - The Soviets , Al Qaida , The French , etc invades your town , killing your husband and trying to destroy your very way of life . Imagine again , that within 6 months , he has learned everything there is to know about being an American , and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen . So dedicated is he to his new `` family '' , that he even goes into battle wearing your dead husband 's uniform . Did I mention that you have fallen madly in love with him ? If this sounds too far-fetched to be true , imagine the same story , only you are Japanese , a race and culture renowned for excluding outsiders and foreigners , as well as a culture that is almost impenetrable in its subtlety . Unbelieveable , is n't it ? Apparently , not if you 're Tom Cruise .",m,0
"`` Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure '' March 4 , 2004 '' Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure '' , is a simple way to describe this movie . I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out . I not only admire Edward Zwick 's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well . Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie , Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely `` factless '' . America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army , They at the time had the best Foot soldiers . Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways , He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did , he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind . The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered `` RONIN '' meaning Samurai with no master , and sense Samurai means `` To serve '' they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable . The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms , it was not the Bows vs . Rifles you see in the movie . And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government , quit the opposite is true . Japan had been divided for more then a century , the clans had known nothing but war . When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace . The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan , the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai , They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai , ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai . It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan . Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete , but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power , status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests . This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history . I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film , I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan . I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I do n't blame them for feeling that way considering there History .",m,0
"Reading this may ruin your viewing of the movie , Last Samurai , by forwarning you of what it is about . < p > The latest Tom Cruise movie , The Last Samurai is a terrific movie -- portraying the role of big business in pushing for and aiding in the elimination of a native culture that was not supportive of trade and commerce , in this case , in Japan . And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple , less technological natives . Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character , asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial , US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais . He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing , the noble thing to do . < p > Why do n't we see American warriors standing up . It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out . But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud , built on lies and stupid unpreparedness . Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait , who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been . < p > The movie was one of the best of the year , with Oscar caliber acting , script , set , and costumes , in a season with a plethora of disappointing films . I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted -- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays , disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures . I write this as a liberal who publishes a liberal news and opinion website op ed news dot com . I 'm curious how conservatives viewed this flick .",m,1
"I went to a `` sneak preview '' tonight and came away a bit underwhelmed . It 's not the worst movie I 've ever sat through ; I found myself checking my watch only a few times wondering how much more I had to sit through . A few interesting characters I liked Ken Watanabe , but nothing really original . Cliche upon cliche . A yawner mostly , but it will entertain people who have not seen any other movies . < p > For me personally , the most remarkable thing about the movie is how fake the sets and special effects looked . Sailing into Yokohama harbor looks ridiculous . A street scene at night in Tokyo where Tom Cruise is surrounded by swordsmen looked entirely like it had been filmed afterhours at Universal Studios in Orlando . Many of the entirely predictable battle scenes look like they are just hundreds of actors outdoors pretending to kill each other . It will be interesting to study these scenes in freeze frame on DVD to see what everybody was doing .",m,0
"A very promessing film , The Last Samurai talks about something that is sacred to many of us : Honor . The willingness to live in accordance with a code honor in all aspects of life . This is shurelly depicted in the conflict beetwen two very different universes and ages . Tom Cruise 's character is ecxactly like this . His niilism and desilusion with the west is replaced by respect and ultimatly union , when he fights the samurai for the first time . Being captured by the enemy he actually finds his peers . All of these men and women become his brothers and sisters living under one of thinking that is juste like his . Looking at the trailer i can garantee a superb blockbuster i tell this .",m,1
Not right for the academy . It 's not bad I here they shot it with digital . I 'm not sure how I feel about that . Bette luck next time Tom,f,0
"Absolutely beautiful . I have not enjoyed the few movies Cruise had done just prior to this movie from Eyes Wide Shut on , they were pretty gross , disturbing , or just awful . . . and I 'm a total Cruise fan . So , hearing that he was going to be in a movie like this , I groaned and thought , `` Damn . I wish he 'd done this movie five years ago . He 'll probably ruin it now . `` But hey , I 'm a total Japanese culture lover , so I figured I 'd watch it anyway . I thought I was disappointed with the movie when it began , because they set up the plot very slowly , and lay out a large amount of information that seems irrelevant . But , like the quiet slice of sword through air , the pieces began to come together , and I found myself enraptured with the film . Ken Watanabe Katsumoto 's presence on the screen is breathtaking , as were his family and friends . Taka , the heroine , was beautiful in her silence , and the scene with her and Tom at the end was . . . well , unforgettable . Omura is excellent and , like the rest of those mentioned here , enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression . Nobutada the archer was , I believe , my favorite character outside of Watanabe . His final scene had me sobbing . But I think most impressive is the way that Tom Cruise does n't dominate this film . It 's almost as if he , like his character , is enraptured and humbled by these people , and he 's purposefully pulling himself in , so that THEY shine on screen . Overall , an absolutely spectacular film . It 's perhaps a bit too intelligent for some , a bit too poignant for others . It is , however , a film that I hope will inspire others . Its lessons are vast . I only wish there were a prequel , so that I could see Katsumoto , Taka , Nobutada , and Omura more , and in all their glory .",m,1
"Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love . At first i though that this movie would be a waste of money , but i was very wrong . Even though i hate extreme violence this movie was an exception .",m,1

"The scenery and set are the best part of the movie , as are the Japanese actors and actresses . The plot is entertaining . Then Tom Cruise comes in and plays , . . . Tom Cruise . He is a looser ex-military drunk who ends up in Japan and teaches this ancient warrior class how to fight . Cruise ' ego once again is center screen , the pretty boy who ca n't act ruins another good movie .",f,0

"This movie was the greatest movie I 've ever seen , it will continue to be my favorite movie for a long time . The war sequences were far better than any other movie like 'Saving Private Ryan ' . The Last Samurai had better special affects and a most intriguing story . I loved the relationship between Algren and the Samurai class , the fight for survival in the newly modernized country Japan after 1868 when Meiji 's reign as Emperor began . Its quite fascinating how this story , even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out . The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo , or `` Dai Saigo '' otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role , a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play . The honor and prestige that each warrior felt back in history was shown in the faces of the individuals that gave their time and skills into making this film historically memorable . I love to read about Japanese history , and I can say right now that they did a spectacular job in recreating the nation of Japan back in the times of Meiji . domo arigatou . . . . . ja ne !",f,1
I held this one off for a long time . I was at the very bottom of my list of movies to see . I just knew it was gon na be trash . Aside from some breathtaking photography this film is dumbed down Hollywood trash . An insult to Japanese filmakers like Akira Kurosawa Seven Samurai and Hiroshi Inagaki Samurai Trilogy who 's Samurai films have captured the hearts of audeinces worldwide . < p > Not only is this film a rip off of those directors but it 's also a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood epics like Braveheart . Probably the worst thing about this film is Tom Cruise 's occaisional narration of his diary . What kind of warrior keeps a diary anyway ? Is n't that for pansies ? Anyway it serves as pointless drivel that mearly point 's out the allready obvious . It 's like they tried to make this film idiot proof . I think they should have focused on making it average joe jane pissed off cause they spent 5 bucks to rent this crap proof . < p > The Characater development in this film was pretty much the same any Jean Claued Van Damme film . Last time I checked & quot ; Kickboxer & quot ; or & quot ; Bloodsport & quot ; did n't get nominated for any Academy Awards . I was just waiting for a training montage . < p > That 's all I 'm gon na write about this film . I have better stuff to review .,m,0
"This film fails both historically and morally . The real Imperial Army was not inept and cowardly as shown in this film . Every Japanese history textbook I 've ever read says that the conscript soldiers were disdained by the haughty samurai , but that they proved their bravery and worth in the battles against them . There 's nothing in this film that shows the arrogance and contempt the samurai had for the & quot ; dirt farmers & quot ; whom they expected to easily defeat , but who stood their ground and shot them to pieces . The samurai , incidentally , had just as many cannons and muskets as their opponents . I can not understand why the filmmaker had to make the samurai 's enemies so evil and stupid , instead of portraying the war as a sincere clash of cultures between men who fought for what they belived in . Morally , it really hurt me to see Tom Cruise Algren wading so cold-bloodedly into the teenage troops he had been training six months ago and butchering them without the slightest compunction . And there was n't even any sort of remorse voiced by Cruise Algren , even in a cliched , off-the-cuff sort of way & quot ; Many brave men on both sides will die today . & quot ; . Maybe he hacked to death that poor , scared man he was trying to teach how to shoot earlier in the film . This is one of those films that , like & quot ; The Patriot & quot ; , gets every cuff button and chin-strap of the costumes right , but fails to capture the spirit of an era and its people by resorting to black-and-white good-and-evil cliches . It looks geat , but has a rotten core .",m,0
"At every opportunity this movie failed in the presentation of its larger themes . To begin with , the presentation of honor , as illustrated through the statements and military tactics of the rebel samurai leader , demonstrated a grotesque misunderstanding of the term . The idea that honor somehow requires a military leader to ignore cutting edge military technology , i . e . firearms , or to blindly charge forward at a numerically superior and better armed foe is laughable . Furthermore , the healing power of love can hardly be demonstrated by a widow who jumps in bed with her husband 's killer before his corpse is even cold , even if the killer is Tom Cruise . On a side note , I could hardly restrain my laughter when Cruise 's character appears in the doorway of the widow 's house wearing her husband 's armor . Regarding the below comments about the racially insensitive aspects of this movie , I completely agree . If I was Japanese , I would be annoyed at how Tom Cruise 's American character , after spending only a short time in the samurai village , ultimately holds himself out to be the highest exponent of the samurai virtues and then presumes to instruct the Emperor on how to act . I get hot under the collar when Europeans comment about how Americans should act or vote . I can only imagine that people of Japanese citizenship or descent would have a similar reaction to the manner in which samurai culture was depicted in this film .",m,0

I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film , I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan . I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I do n't blame them for feeling that way .",m,0
"Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood . Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles , romance , outstanding performances , and the cream of the crop celebrities . These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards . The problem is every year one film is so big , so bloated , and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess . This year 's film is EDWARD ZWICK 'S THE LAST SAMURAI . A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER 'S LIST . < p > The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise Vanilla Sky as Captain Algern , a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand . While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children , and it eats away at his soul . Turning him to drink . < p > When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto Ken Wantanabe , T . R . Y . . Everything seems okay . That is until he 's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai . < p > THE LAST SAMURAI at it 's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I 've seen in a long time . I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles , because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady . It simply was n't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around . It was real , and true battle choreography . Now that made me smile . < p > I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend . The scene actually works and is a rare sight . A modern fight scene that does n't feature wire effects or CGI . It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies . A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it . < p > SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto . Enemies that become friends , Wantanabe 's character is strong because it feels real . Unlike SONNY CHIBA 's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL . Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject . I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king . < p > SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it 's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , THE SEVEN SAMURAI , CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON , and DANCES WITH WOLVES , when it 's really just a fun battle movie . It takes itself far too seriously . You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you 'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says `` FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION . `` < p > It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003 . Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams `` SAKI '' at the top of his lungs . I was sitting next to my brother-in-law , and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper `` Saki ! ! `` It kept me entertained . < p > I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there . There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head . Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder . LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD , THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOES N'T HAPPEN . YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE . DO N'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT . Calming Down Thank you ! < p > THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag . On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly . I 'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences . But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance . They are far better films . < p > *** out of 5",m,0
"Set in 1870 's Japan , `` The Last Samurai '' is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing . < p > Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren , a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians . Now drifting aimlessly through life , Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation 's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons . Once he is captured by the `` enemy , `` however , Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle , ending up fighting with the samurai whom he views as the equivalent of `` Indian underdogs '' in the struggle against the people he was brought over to train . The film , thus , becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions . < p > Director Edward Zwick , who made one of the best war films of modern times `` Glory '' , has had less success here , mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we ca n't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film . In many ways , `` The Last Samurai '' is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes . Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony . It 's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren 's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another 's heads . And all the talk about `` honor , `` `` shame , `` the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle do n't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence . The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them , but it is , ultimately , a distinction without a difference . So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate , the movie loses its grip on us in a major way . The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject . < p > Technically , `` The Last Samurai '' is a mighty impressive achievement . In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city , the film 's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout . There are , also , some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film , though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface particularly in Algren 's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' is a joy to look at , but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than , I 'm sure , it both wanted and intended to be .",m,0
"In 1876 , Nathan Algren Tom Cruise is living in a bottle . He is a Captain in the U . S . Army who is so ashamed of the things he did in the Indian Wars under Gen . Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories . Unable to keep a job , he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man . Along with a few other military officers , including his old Colonel Tony Goldwyn , whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders , and Algren 's friend Zebulon Gant Billy Connolly , he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare . Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism , and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai , who believe that by modernizing , Japan is losing its sense of self . The Samurai , led by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values . After the first battle , the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors , and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself . Sensing his strength , Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied . While in Katsumoto 's village , Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai , including their discipline , their loyalty , and most importantly for Algren , their serenity . This was a great film ; it dealt with loyalty , moral ambiguity , and courage . The story , while somewhat predictable , was a good one to tell . However , this story probably is not very accurate , but that can be overlooked . There are some logic problems Algren learned Japanese FAST , but once again , they do n't detract from this great film .",m,1
"This movie was filmed in Australia and not like Japan at all , there is even scene with coconut tree ! This movie is Japan from eyes of American , not bushido , NOT TRUE SAMURAI , not the heart of Japan . Japanese emperor and bushido are not heterogenous , this movie mislead of Japan conception . Why ninja attacking village ? Was this still playing active part in Japan which became Meiji ? -No . The scene when children eat meal without having a rice bowl in left hand , this is very ill mannered in Japanese meal , and this also Samurai 's child ? -No . To say `` This Hollywood film drew the heart of Japan or samurai correctly '' is profanity to the samurai who fought for the resturation of Japan . -- - A rental is enough , I think we see only one time even if we buy it .",m,0
"i may pick this film , but I think that certain things take away from the overall story . first , i think it would have been better completely without Tom Cruise 's character . Just Ken Watanabe 's character . Secondly , there was this one part where you watch Tom Cruise fight some guys , then directly after , you have to watch it over again . it was supposed to add dramatic effect , but i hated it . i already saw it once , why do i have to see it again ? finally , the ending sucked . it was just Tom Cruise acting like he was an angry drunk and it did n't make any sense why he did n't die . Ken Watanabe 's character was actually cool , why did he die and Tom Cruise live ? other than that , it was a pretty good film .",m,0
"First off , The Good : The cinematography , though sometimes almost TOO glossy slick for it 's own good , is consistently excellent , but then it is by John Toll Braveheart , The Thin Red Line so no surprise there . Ken Watanabe is fine , noble , strong yet vulnerable and easily out-acts Cruise without breaking a sweat . He does more with a glance than Cruise can do with his whole grunting straining scowling arsenal of Master Thespian Acting tricks . In fact most of the Japanese cast is uniformly above average . Some of the battle sequences were intense and well staged , particularly the Ninja attack , but to even begin to compare them with Braveheart , as some reviewers have done here , invites incredulity . The Bad : Hans Zimmer 's music nearly overwhelms several scenes in the worst sledgehammer way , underlining and cueing the audience into what emotion they should be feeling in every scene instead of merely setting and enhancing mood . Contrast this with the same composer 's outstanding score for The Thin Red Line incidentally a FAR superior film in every respect about men in battle war self-conflict . Then there 's Mr . Tom Cruise . . . what to say about pretty boy ? He wants that bloody Oscar SO BAD you can see him straining with the effort in nearly every scene . Several times I thought that bulging vein in his forehead was simply going to burst right there on screen . At least that would have been entertaining to watch . Cruise can be effective given the right role and a strong enough director to rein in his own worst instincts this summer 's Collateral for example . I 'm afraid Mr . Zwick was not up to the challenge . And , The Ugly : the ending . OH MY GAWD ! I saw it coming and still did n't believe it would really go there , but yup , sure enough , Our Intrepid Hero gets to lead the suicide charge , miraculously survive it , help the REAL hero commit sepuku , stare down the emperor into shame , AND make his way back to the picture-postcard lotus blossom village to shack up with the wife of the man he killed ! Alrighty then . This may have sunk to a new all time low in over-the-top , ludicrously inappropriate , spiked-on happy endings that completely invalidate everything the film has labored to create , even if unsuccessfully , for the last 150 minutes ! ! ! Honor ? If Cruise has indeed learned anything about the Samurai code of honor , he would have disemboweled himself on the last battlefield along with the other guy ! But no and I can see Mr . Cruise 's fingerprints all over this he has to be the defiant hero who overcomes all odds , redeems himself AND gets the girl too . Puh-leeze . Even though I was dissatisfied with much of what had come before , a decent ending could have at least redeemed the film somewhat . As it stands , it merely reinforced and truly unmasked The Last Samurai for the conventional Hollywood claptrap that it is .",m,0

"Beautifully shot ~~ , if only tom cruises character in this film could be , Its a good film . But a few things really grate , 1 . Cheapening of martial artslearning the art of the sword and unarmed combat in 3 months vs someone whose spent their life with it and he can draw that man in 3 months plz . wow the actor spent 8 months learning martial arts for this movie , he must be REALLY good in 8 months , like thats almost a year of training in martial arts , sword and unarmed combat . Silly me it only took me 10 years to study unarmed combat , im living in japan , and i still couldnt take on 5 people with swords . I must just be so stupid . Fact : guns kill people far more effectively than swords . It doesnt matter how much philosophy and dedication to training as soon as guns came around swords and unarmed combat took second place . 3 months film time 8 months real time does not make tom cruise or his character a ninja capable of taking on 5 trained armed assasins , he being unarmed because he lost his revolver and didnt notice . . . yeah right . That scene from Indiana jones comes to mind , sword guy meet revolver . 2 . Blatantly ripping off other films , 19th century soldier with deathwish goes native and fights for the other side , man leading horse into pasture at the end , oh plz , and savage warriors charging a disciplined army , cough cough braveheart cough . 3 . The man charges a row of gattling guns , um hello ? people dont get up and act heroic after that . They just die , Thats the point , it was the pivotal machine for empire making of the late 19th century to early 20th . 4 . Billy Connolly u cant do irish u might think u can but really u cant just play it real and scottish . this film is a 3 4 star , its an ok film , but honestly to give this 5 stars is a bit hopeful woefully uncritical written by someone with vested interest in selling it ?",m,0

"In the 19th Century Japan became part of the world . For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun . His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai . Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare . < p > The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy . To do this he imported overseas advisors , Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy . The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages . This film is about this revolt . < p > Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer . This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale . At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation . However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent . < p > Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character . That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children . This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life . In this film he is redeemed . < p > He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter . In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan . In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre . He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans . < p > The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history . The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision , as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country . Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians . < p > The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in .",m,0
"I happen to see this film tonight and for the life of me I can not fathom the near universal praise . Let me start with Mr . Cruise . While Born on the 4th revealed he had some emotional depth and especially his work in Magnolia , in this film he is absolutely awful . He runs the gamut from A to B . The opening scene where he has to act `` drunk '' I could literally `` see '' him acting . The rest of the film he has a total of three facial expressions . One ; the glowering warrior all squinting eyes and clenched jaw , noble , resolute and certain of his convictions . Two , the compassionate puppy dog either staring blankly at the widow or with supposed affection for her two boys . And lastly , the Zen look where he visualises scenes of combat or contemplates the idyllic life of the Japanese peasants . Why do so many American films have this obsession of placing caucasian males in usually exotic or third world scenarios where the White man has the duty to civilize the natives , attract the native wenches and somehow be an apologist for Vietnam , slavery , the American Indians or any socially relevant cause . This film is deeply insulting to the Japanese as it portrays them in the same old stereotypes . The xenophobic , emotionally stunted , devious and insular Asian . Beyond the superbly staged action scenes , this film is just another one off the Hollywood conveyor belt in the tradition of `` Genghis Khan '' with the original `` Top Gun '' , the Duke . As i came out of the theater I couldnt believe that they still make this kind of rubbish in 2003 .",m,0
"The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves . Once again , a formerly evil American U . S . Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U . S . imperialism . At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe . Actually , the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right . The samurai preyed on the peasants . Eventually , as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan , a new national army based on the peasantry was formed . When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges . the national army defeated them . The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history . Avoid it like the plague .",m,0

"Samurai as good , honourable soldier who hold onto traditional value is like sharks in Finding Nemo who are vegetarian . It is totally FAKE . Samurai are in essense ultra-loyal soldiers for Japanese Emperior . Chinese and rest of Asia knows very well that these are people who kills civillians , children , women and anyone else if the Emperior ask them too . Modernise or not is just the weapon they take up , not the mentality they have . < p > I am so sorry and angry that Hollywood have continued to romantize the 'Japanese value ' . Do n't you people knows Japanese soldiers were like NAZI in Asia in World War ? Even worse , they never apologize for their wrong during the war . They portrait themselves as survivors of the atomic bombs , victims of the wars when they are the PREDATORS who invade other countries in the first place Why can they get away with this ? That 's because the West are so impressed by the Samuria code of HONOUR to realize it is exactly this code of unquestionable loyalty that cause so much suffering over Asia . The Last Samurai may be an epic and Tom Cruise may have made Oscar worthy performance but would you honour a film portraiting how loyal Nazi was to Hitler or how English soldiers bravely killing Native Americans ?",f,0
"`` Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure '' , is a simple way to describe this movie . I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out . I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick 's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well . Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie , Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely `` factless '' . America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army , They at the time had the best Foot soldiers . Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways , He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did , he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind . The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered `` RONIN '' meaning Samurai with no master , and sense Samurai means `` To serve '' they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable . The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms , it was not the Bows vs . Rifles you see in the movie . And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government , quit the opposite is true . Japan had been divided for more then a century , the clans had known nothing but war . When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace . The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan , the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai , They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai , ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai . It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan . Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete , but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power , Status and Wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests . This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history . I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film , I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan . I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I do n't blame them for feeling that way .",m,0
I am not a Tom Cruise fan . In fact I think he is a bit of a nut . But . . . after saying that this is a good performance for him . While the plot is fairly predictable I think it is an interesting look into a historical time period . A transition from an ancient tradition in Japan into the modern age . I would recommend the film to anyone who loves history .,m,1
"This movie is a very interesting look at opportunism , guilt and shame on the one hand and opportunity , pride and honor on the other . The irony throughout the movie was a comparing of these things within two cultural frameworks . The clash between the old world being encroached upon by a new world . < p > The comparison between the opportunism of the US against the native American tribes compared to the resistance of the old world Japanese Samurai was fascinating to say the least . The characters that were played by Watanabe and Cruise were very much linked through similar issues but from vastly different persepectives . < p > Cruise plays a US Calvary Captain Nathan Algren who is tormented by his past and when he goes to Japan on a mercenary mission to assist the Emperor 's minions in defeating the last hold out of the old ways he is forced to see himself and the world he is from through a different lens . < p > The cavalier versus the discipline and strength of the Samurai are showed over again . Algren goes through a metamorphasis of sorts . It is a different look at the issues of east versus west . < p > At varying points in the film , Algren is seen going through a conflict in his mind that torments him . He is seen running from and with this scene playing within his psyche at all times . His torment reaches it 's climax in his captivity . That is where the story changes and a man is free . < p > The issues that contain the ironies are things to look for , the western ways of expediency and convenience versus the eastern ways of patience . Katsumoto Watanabe has a righteous anger , yet you need to listen carefully to his raging with the Emperor . . . . . < p > Algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality . I was left to wonder if there is a metaphor regarding today 's east verse west conflict . Today , some of the west come to adopt eastern ideology and even side with those in conflict with their societies . It seems more that Cruise is accepting a cause than anything else and releases himself from his torment . < p > The movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow , to anger to love and deep reflection . This is rated R yet only for the violence and some language , there is no sex , no nudity and very little language and some of what is spoken is almost humorous . Billy Connoly looks like John Cleese . He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree . < p > Tony Goldwyn plays Cruise 's alter-ego who stays in character throughout . < p > The battle scenes , from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely . I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars . It is from the same timeframe and to me it seems possible that the message was easier to get across so that it would be acceptable for those who are resistant to politically correct messages . < p > The basic story though is well thought out and well presented . I would have rated it a 5 and many would do so as well , yet the `` BraveHeart '' type violence to me is getting a little worn thin . The sheer violence of the small battle that ensued in Tokyo was enough to show intensity and bravado . The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic . I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene . < p > The sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me . < p > I will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list .",m,1
"Brilliant performance not only from Tom Cruise but also from other Japanese actors & amp ; actress . This is a relatively long movie last over 2 . 5 hours but you wo n't find a single boring scene .

"The story focuses on a Civil War veteran named Capt . Nathan Algren Tom Cruise . He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country 's remaining Samurai . Unfortunately , Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai , and is held prisoner by them . The leader of the Samurai , Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him . As time passes , Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto . He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well , and trains to become one of them , so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them . < p > With the acception of `` Mystic River '' , `` The Last Samurai '' was my favorite film of 2003 . For 2 1 2 hours , I was literally glued to the screen , and loving every minute of it . It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film . The only downfall this film may have , is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of `` Dances with Wolves '' . However , that does not make the film any less enjoyable . In fact , `` The Last Samurai '' is almost better . The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai . They have a deeper sense of honor , and their fighting style is much more deadly . Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture , from the costume designs and simple way of life , to the weaponry and fighting style . The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since `` Braveheart '' . The Samurai are completely outnumbered , and still manage to put up one heck of a fight . Tom Cruise gave one of the best , if not the best performance of his career . However , the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe . He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior . The film 's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well . < p > Overall , `` The Last Samurai '' is an amazing film . Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately , the performances given by the actors involved were amazing , and the final battle was incredible . Also , please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set . From the look of things , the extras are reason enough to purchase this film . There are deleted scenes , featurettes on the making of the film , a featurette comparing real life Samurai , and more . This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film , and the Samurai in general . < p > A solid 5 stars . . .",m,1
"A disillusioned , alcoholic American soldier Tom Cruise hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader Ken Watanabe , but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle . This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it . It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes . The photography , costuming , and production design are astonishing , presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life . The cast is mostly excellent , especially Watanabe , who should be remembered at Oscar time . However , there are two things that work against this film . The first is Tom Cruise himself . Although he does good work here , he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character . The biggest problem is the film 's ending , which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention . Nevertheless , the things that work in this film really work well , resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature .",m,1
"This movie is wonderful in Blu-ray and DTS digital surround . These formats were created for movies with great vistas and battle scenes , which abound here . It 's a movie about honor , bravery , nobility and redemption . Along the way we have subplots including the clash of civilizations in 19th century Japan , a tender , thought-provoking love story , an action thriller and a buddy movie between the Tom Cruise character , Captain Algren and the Samurai warrior , Lord Katsumoto , played by Ken Watanabe , who gives a better performance than Cruise , IMO . I 'm not Tom Cruise 's biggest fan . I consider him to be more of a movie star than he is an actor , yet I keep finding myself watching and enjoying his movies and this is my favorite . He did a fine job in this movie , however . Not perfect but not much is . It was a difficult part , in that he had to convincingly portray a man going through major changes . The redemption I mentioned , had to have been emotionally challenging for the actor . He did all his own stunts , btw . The direction , filming and editing is as good as anything you 're going to see . The Blu-ray transfer was excellent . The sets , primarily in the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and in New Zealand were outstanding . The extras were equally outstanding , with the voice-over commentary by director Edward Zwick going more into his emotional journey with the film far more than the usual `` making of '' , although there 's plenty of that in the extras as well . I gave it 4 stars .",m,1
"A stunning story and modern classic ! Very well told and acted . The sets were incredible ! The evolution of the main character was played out perfectly , and the story within the story could n't have been better . This is a cinematic work of art !",m,1
This is a must have for any Bollywood film collector . The soundtrack alone is worth the investment . The film is also very interesting and should bring a smile to most anyones face .,m,1
"Gumnaam Raja Nawathe , 1965 One wag , reviewing this film for IMDB , called it `` the Plan 9 of India '' , and I ca n't say he 's terribly far off in that . While it was obviously meant as a mystery thriller IMDB also reports the script was based on Agatha Christie 's Ten Little Indians , which would bring new latitude to the definition of the term `` loose '' , watching it forty-five years later , Gumnaam has all the hallmarks of a classic unintentional comedy . This would have been great fodder for MST3K . Note to self : get ahold of the Cinematic Titanic team . . . . Plot : at the beginning of the movie , we see a man murdered . The guy who seems to be behind it contacts a series of people by phone before being murdered himself . Cut to the Princess Club , a dance joint where we get the first of those oddly inappropriate musical numbers germane to Bollywood flicks . The dance is great , and if you 're a Bones fan , the lead dancer could pass for Michaela Conlin 's mom . That alone might be reason enough for you to catch this . Mrow ! Afterwards , the MC gets up and announces the winners of a lucky draw , who will be sent on an all-expenses-paid vacation to . . . well , we 're never told where . Not that it matters ; after a spat of `` engine trouble '' we see the pilot obviously fiddling with the controls , they all land on an island somewhere in the Indian Ocean I think , may have been the South Pacific . Everyone gets out to stretch their legs , including the co-pilot , Anand Manoj Kumar , already a superstar by 1965 ; he played the title role in Shaheed earlier that year . Once everyone 's clear , the pilot suddenly takes off , leaving his hapless charges on what seems to be an abandoned island . Among them is Asha Prem Rog 's Nanda , the niece of the murdered man from the opening scene , whom mastermind-guy had called to offer his condolences and gloat ? just before being shot . We also have a lawyer named Rakesh Bobby 's Pran , who gets the Best Beard in Bollywood award ; a doctor , Acharaya Pyaar ka Saagar 's Madan Puri ; a party girl , Miss Kitty Bombay 405 Miles ' Helen -- the only member of this cast to still have a career , appearing in the upcoming Dunno y na Jaane Kyun . . . , which opens October 22 , 2010 ; Dharamdas , who may have another job but passes his time on the island indulging in his passion for fishing Brahmachari 's Dhumal ; Madhusudan Benazir 's Tarun Bose , who . . . um , I never quite caught what he did ; and Kishan Kathputli 's Man Mohan , an alcoholic who 's got a thing for Miss Kitty . The party eventually stumble upon a large mansion in the middle of a jungle , where they 're greeted by a Hitler-hairstyle-wearing butler Dev Anand in Goa 's Mehmood who tells them he 's been expecting their arrival . . . It 's a lot of characters to throw at you in rapid succession , and one of the movie 's greatest successes is that you get to know who 's who pretty quickly , and they all have distinct personalities that shine through rather than being a muddle of interchangeable serial killer fodder . On the flip side of this is the plot , which is outlandish from the beginning , but truly begins to fall apart about forty-five minutes before the end of the movie , and really comes unglued during the climax . There 's a certain type of ending to a mystery that is , to be blunt , a complete cheat , and this one utilizes it . And then there are the oddly inappropriate musical numbers ; while they 're not as oddly out of place here as they are in , say , Rain : The Terror Within nothing like a musical number during an attempted rape ! , it does n't matter how awesome the scenery and how warm the rain , breaking into a song about frustrated love just does n't seem right when you 've discovered a dead body , you know ? Still , despite its serious shortcomings and I rush to add the bulk of the movie 's rating comes from that very , very severe plot defect mentioned above , there 's a lot to like about this flick . It 's very easy on the eyes , the dialogue is witty , the butler is the intentional part of the hilarity and does his job well every time he 's onscreen , and if you 're a smoker , you 'll wax nostalgic for the days when everyone pulled out cigars and pipes at the dinner table . Oh , and the peer pressure in this movie is great while , again , nothing as outrageous as in Rain , some of the interplay between Kitty [ `` I like alcoholics , but I do n't like alcohol ! `` ] and Kishan [ `` Just drink this one little one . . . for me . . . `` ] could easily be construed as coercive ; the easily-triggered should take note . In short : if you 're a bad movie connoisseur , this is must viewing . Others , take or leave at will . * ½",m,0

"This is a sci-fi action with magic thrown in .

"In terms of mindless adventure films , this one was excellent from the beginning . Plenty of action sequences , battles , and nasty terminator robots . I ca n't fault the film : it 's a generous serving of goofy fun . But it 's when you get into the subplot and the mysterious Marcus character that things start to get a little bit perplexing . Spoilers start below : spoilers From the beginning , you know something is fishy with Marcus , and there are some creative parallels suggesting he might be a terminator himself , but once the bomb is dropped and we find out that he is a strange terminator human hybrid , then the questions start rolling in . I lost sleep after this film , pondering how exactly certain problems in this scenario could be figured out . For instance , he 's a terminator with a human brain : would n't he start to question his lack of ability to eat or drink , or desire to ? And what about bathroom functions ? If you still had a human brain in a terminator body , would n't you start to question why those details do n't matter anymore ? And how could a heart function without the rest of the circulatory system , such as lungs to give the heart oxygen , or bone marrow for blood cells , etc , etc ? And if the final terminator gave Marcus a massive damaging heart punch at the end , why would that make for a healthy heart for a transfer ? And in a post-apocalpytic setting , would they even have the facilities and medicines to accomplish a heart transplant ? Even more perplexing is that the goofy robots of Cyberdyne would devise THIS sort of system to try to outsmart John Connor . Would n't it make more sense to try more time travel , and this time go after Sarah Connor 's mom , or something more linear and logical like that ? Anyhow , if you do n't read into the film , and do n't think of too deeply , it 's good fun . Seeing Michael Ironsides in action again as the , well , the Michael Ironsides character again , was a nice touch as well . But come on , did John Connor really dive into the ocean and swim into a submarine ?",m,0
"I really enjoyed this movie . I think it was the best one I saw that year . The story was straight sci fi . The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators . They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type . The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done . Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie . I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies . I think he did the alien queen in aliens . Anyway the special effect are really well done . I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place . That is when the special effects are done well . Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested . I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection . The music is done well and is very emotional . It was done by Danny Elfman . The acting and story was top notch . It is a story of sacrifice and redemption . The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional . Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character . I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer . I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie . The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role . Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role . Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone . Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this . Recommended to families to watch with children over 13 . I think the parents wo n't find anything objectionable . If you have n't seen this due to hearing that it was n't good . Give it a chance . I liked it , maybe you will too . Kevin",m,1

Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past . Good but not great . A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4 . Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter . This is where Terminator Salvation falls short . It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o . k . sequel . Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness .,f,1
"I love this movie , It is intense and very action packed . I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it .",m,1
"Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the Terminator series . It 's also the lesser of the four . The first three starred Ah-Nuld , and were great because of him . Terminator Salvation stars Christian Bale and is slightly above average in spite of him . The action is good , the Terminators are great including that one that looks identical to Arnold S . circa 1984 , but the story is n't . They just do n't make action movies the way they used to , when they not only had good action , but they also had something to entertain you even when something was n't blowing up . When nothing is being shot or blown up onscreen , Terminator : Salvation is pretty boring . Still , I 'd take Terminator : Salvation over Transformers , Iron Man 2 , and G . I . Joe .",m,0
"This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators , know it , but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs , brains as well .

"Buy or rent ? Buy or rent ? What to do . . . what to do ? Well , here 's a word of advice : If you 're like me and you want to see the Director 's Cut the R version versus the Theatrical PG-13 version , buy this . Because I first rented it from Netflix , but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that 's PG-13 . I found this especially odd because I ca n't find a Blu Ray version for sale that 's PG-13 . So how and why is it that Netflix 's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13 ? Am I sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . There is no mention of Director 's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself . The disc did indeed say Blu Ray . And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA . But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director 's Cut extra 's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo 's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product . Regardless of whether you get the Director 's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version , you 're in for an average movie viewing experience at best . I was certainly entertained . I love the Terminator movies . . . especially T1 and T2 . I know a lot folks hated T3 ; I for one did not hate T3 . T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2 , but it was n't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound . No , I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average . . . in their own unique ways . And I 'll tell ya , it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie ? Have you heard that ? Oh my God , what a chump . Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale ; Worthington 's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year 's remake of < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B00005JKO7 '' > Clash of the Titans < a > . Got ta give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too ; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn the guy who played Reese in the original < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000F9RB9Y '' > Terminator < a > . But the story in Salvation did n't come close to living up to what Terminator or < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001RIY4WE '' > Terminator 2 : < a > delivered . Salvation 's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations , and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations . How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director 's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series ? Maybe he did n't teeny-bop Salvation , but it was very weeknight CW networked up . Bottom line : Terminator Salvation is a rental , but if you rent it at least be sure that you 're getting the Director 's Cut . One way to be sure that you get the Director 's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart . Buy or rent ? Buy or rent ? What to do . . . what to do ?",m,0
"I thought this was a great Science Fiction film . Granted it was later surpassed by District 9 and Avatar , but this movie was the best one for the summer . It was n't without problems , but it had a terrific atmosphere to it , a lot of innovative shots and an exciting plot which moves along nicely . This is what I expected from this film , a sort of a prequel and a sequel that sets up the events of the apocalypse , of the Skynet fallout . What 's not to like here ? The cool characters ? the solid acting by Bale , Worthington , Kyle Reese , the Moon character . . the intense fighting scenes ? the feeling of the great sadness . . . similar to that of Battlestar Galactica Reimagined ?

"T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it 's layered with modern themes , awesome action , and inspired performances from Hamilton , Furlong , and Morton . Cameron is a jerk , but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore . Outside of that , Terminator : Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea . The effects are first class , there are some decent action sequences well choreographed but they ca n't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs . If you 're a fan , you 'll find yourself going , `` what ? `` and `` I knew it ! `` alternately through the film . But you 'll also say `` that was cool '' a few times , too . Just do n't expect another T2 . . . it 's hard to outshine such brilliance , and the Terminator series struggles to meet the bar of regular film offerings with every installment .",m,0

"Sometimes , you wonder when it 's time to stop , and let a franchise die . Or at the least , make sure the story is coherent and fits in well with what 's come before . But most importantly , try to give the story weight . If we do n't care about what 's going on , pretty much nothing is going to save the film , and that 's the problem with Terminator Salvation . Taking place in 2018 , the film follows the famed John Connor and newcomer Marcus Wright , as both men fight for their lives in the post-judgment day world . Killer machines roam the skies and the ground . While the resistance has found a possible way to shut down the machines for good , the fate of mankind hangs in the balance , as the legendary Kyle Reese , John 's father , has been found . The problem is , the machines are after him . With both John and Skynet after Kyle , both sides must fight for the fate of the future . When I first saw the movie in theaters , I left feeling that the film was , at best , an average action adventure movie . After seeing it again on DVD , time has not been kind to `` Salvation '' , as the story feels very disjointed and choppy , as if the film was hacked to pieces and then edited back together . It feels like entire segments of the film are missing , and the second half of the film moves too quickly for us to get emotionally interested . By the time the end credits rolled around , I just did n't care . I did n't care about the characters , I did n't care about the story , or even the action . This is probably Terminator Salvation 's biggest problem . . . for all the action sequences , for all the nods to the previous films , the story is the weakest yet in the series . While the idea of saving Kyle Reese to ensure the events of the future past happen sounds like a great idea , having the film jump back and forth between Marcus and John makes it feel disjointed . We do n't get time to understand the characters in any meaningful way , besides the most basic of reasons . John wants to save Kyle . Marcus wants to find out who he is . Barnes wants to avenge his brother 's offscreen death . Kyle wants to stay alive . As a result , we have a cast of essentially one dimensional characters that pale in comparison to the cast of the previous three films . Some , like Star , are completely unnecessary and could have been cut from the script . Say what you will about Terminator 3 I personally really enjoyed it , but it had a focused plot that added to the franchise 's mythology with the revelation that Judgment day was just postponed , not stopped . The film had weight to it , making us wonder if the heroes were going to stop Judgement Day once again . Here , everything is back to the status quo at the end . There are no long term changes or consequences of the ongoing story . There 's just no emotional weight to what 's going on , and coupled with the disjointed pacing and thin characters , the film feels utterly flat . Considering how all the previous stories have at least contributed much to the ongoing story , `` Salvation '' 's story is a disappointment . With the poor story and characters , we 're left with the action sequences , and regrettably , they do n't fare much better . We have the standard chase scenes with cars , assaults on Skynet bases , and fights with killer robots , but most feel like your standard issue summer action scenes . The nighttime escape scene in the forest , for example , is utterly flat , save for the sequence in the river . Then there 's the giant transformer like robot at the gas station . . . I thought it was goofy in the theater , and it 's only worse in a second viewing . Why not replace it with a giant Skynet tank instead ? Why not a whole group of T-600 's out to capture human prisoners ? This giant just feels out of place here . Yet , despite it 's stumbling , `` Salvation '' does get a few things right . The overall mood and art design of the film , with it 's shades of greys , blacks , and blues , does an excellent job creating a post apocalyptic world , and I did like the idea of showing us what the war between man and machine looked like before the technology of lasers and time travel is created . Sam Worthington does a good job of conveying the tough , yet confused Marcus , and Anton Yelchin is outstanding as a young Kyle Reese , and is easily the best actor of the film , making you believe that he really is a young version of Michael Biehn . It 's also a nice treat that Linda Hamilton returned to do voice overs for John 's famous audio tapes . The opening action sequence , an assault on a Skynet Base set amongst dozens of giant satellite dishes , is quite exciting . But the best part of the film easily comes in the third act , with a cameo appearance by a well known character from the previous films . . . it 's only after this character appears that the film finally becomes really interesting . But in the end , `` Salvation '' is a disappointing entry into the Terminator franchise . With it 's weak story , weak characters , choppy pacing , and below average to average action sequences , there 's really not much to recommend it here . There are a few good action sequences , and a few good performances by the actors , but that 's really it . Terminator fans will probably get the most out of it , but everyone else should stick to the first three films .",m,0

"As a fan of the entire Terminator movie series , you would be forgiven for assuming that I would hate this movie . The truth is that I did n't watch this movie hoping it would match the brilliance of the original movies as I knew that simply was n't going to happen . What we got was not a film that captured the terrifying doomsday essence of what made Cameron 's two Terminator films so brilliant . We also did n't even get the cool and slick looking destruction heavy style of the third Terminator film . What we got instead was , what I felt , to be a perfectly captured post-apocalyptic world which contains a marvellous depiction of the human race when faced with what seems as the impossible fight for survival . Director McG has received a lot of doubt about his ability move the Terminator saga into the post-apocalyptic world which we first gained a glimpse of in the first Terminator movie . That doubt had no foundation and what McG presented in the finished piece , although the plot could do with some polishing , was a fantastically frightening environment with some cool effects and worthy acting throughout . The plot sets John Connor in the year 2018 . The machine uprising has begun and only small pockets of human resistance movements exist with the soul purposes of surviving and destroying the machine threat . John Connor has finally entered the position he was fated to enter since before he was born and is now the leader of the human resistance . He has encountered the machines before which gives him and his teams the advantage when knowing what they will be put up against as the human machine war continues . As the resistance fight continues Connors father , Kyle Reese encounters Marcus Wright who we see at the start of the movie receiving lethal injections on death row just before the war begins . Marcus does n't know what 's happened as he woke up in the post-apocalyptic world with no memory of the machine initial attempt at destroying the human race . Marcus quickly partners up with Kyle Reese and a child we know as Star who are also on a mission to find the resistance leader and join the fight . The mystery eventually unfolds and we find out whether Marcus was sent from the future or is merely a survivor of the past and he becomes pivotal in the fight against the machine threat . The film itself was very touch and go throughout . Some parts worked where others did n't but the entire piece presented an enjoyable action movie that does n't go too much into the fight for survival on the psychological end of things but does retain the aura of desperation that the humans feel in their fight . Christian Bale was surprisingly awful in this and I honestly expected more from a man taking the reigns of the legendary John Connor . Bale presented an ultimately one dimensional character and you had to question his motives of taking the role of this infamous movie character . The mysterious Marcus Wright character , played by the brilliant Sam Worthington is a movie saving character from start to finish . His whole performance is brilliant throughout and manages to drive the plot along successfully with very little to work with in terms of original character depth . Kyle Reese played by the brilliant up and comer Anton Yelchin is also a delightful addition to the movie and adds again a bit of depth to the movies plot . Other supporting cast include Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor 's wife Cate . Also , a cool little cameo piece goes to the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Dr . Serena Kogan who is a Doctor for Cyberdyne Systems and actually turns out to have a more pivotal role . The action is brilliant throughout and with the apparent unbeatable nature of the machines this manages to present quite a daunting aspect to the theatre of the battles that ensue . The scale of the machine warfare is quite disappointing as when we first glimpsed the human machine war in the first movie , we gained a glimpse of what seemed to be a constantly chaotic battle which left us wanting more . This film does n't use Cameron 's image as McG takes away the futuristic lasers and hoards of machines lined up executing human after human and he exchanges it for the odd flying scouting machine , a large harvester robot which merely collects the humans for what seems to be mass slaughter and of course , the T-600 machines which are a less advanced model of the T-800 machine which we all know as the 101 machine or Arnold Schwarzenegger who we all miss from this movie . This is probably what the movie is lacking the most as the absence of Arnie is certainly a drag for the Terminator franchise and I 'm sure that if the effort were put into the writing , they could have found a role for the older Arnold in this film . There 's not denying that Terminator Salvation lacks the charm and excitement of its trilogy of predecessors , however , there 's a lot that this film brings to the Terminator universe . The possibility of John Connors son , the look at the early models of the Terminator machines and the new machine concepts make it quite enjoyable . Had the acting been a bit better and the supporting cast a higher level of significance , this film could have been on par with the original 3 . It 's still a good film and a worthwhile waste of just under two hours .",m,1
"T4 is a film that had so much potential but sadly barely fails to deliver . I love the imagery of the film , the smoky , grimy dirtiness of everything , the decaying city vistas . The acting was actually good , not on the level of T2 but still well enough to keep the audience absorbed in the film . Sam Worthington in his American debut , even though he had already filmed `Avatar ' , steals the movie from Christian Bale . Salvation lacks something . We get see the T-600 models of the Terminators , but we do n't get to see them in full force , only three or four personal encounters and not a full on battle in the post nuclear wasteland . It 's not an actual war movie and that 's what Terminator fans wanted to see , full on early battles between humanity and Skynet that were hinted at in the first two films , but instead we only get commando raids that begin and end the movie with formulaic action sequences in between . We also do n't see John Conner lead . He 's either being bossed around by command or working with a small number . It 's Marcus who 's the real star and a far more interesting story . A criminal gets the needle in ought three suddenly wakes up fifteen years later in the middle of a destroyed laboratory and must figure out what the hell is going on and becomes horribly freaked out when he discovers that he 's actually just a heart and a brain inside a synthetic body .",m,0
"Like many Terminator fans , I was highly skeptical of this film 's genuineness . After all , when films change hands , many times the real flow gets lost in the other director 's point of view or a prematurely finished film . `` Salvation '' surprisingly does n't stray too far from what I would call the genuineness of the storyline . A few spots make you cringe a bit because the lines `` come with me if you want to live '' and `` there 's no fate by what we make '' are regurgitated in the film . However even though the first half was hard to get into , by the time the movie is 3 4 done , you are sucked in completely . This is not anything like the other Terminator movies , as it is based in the present , not in the past . . . and it 's more of a sci-fi war film than a story-based sci-fi thriller . The appearance of the Arnold-looking T-800 towards the end nails it down . The first T-800 appears , and it immediately hones in on John Connor . It is indestructable and incredibly merciless . A wonderful foreshadowing of the human-cyborg terminators . Details are well-scripted , even to the very detail of John Connor 's face getting scarred by the Terminator 's nails compare his scars in Terminator 2 at the beginning , when Commander John Connor is lowering his binoculars . The rescue of young Kyle Reese was wonderful , but the introduction of Kyle made him look like a street rat who steals things and vandalizes . All with his little black kid side kick . I would have appreciated a little more depth , a way to get to know the characters better so you can really connect . This is obviously missing when compared to the work of Cameron in the first two installments . Story-wise this film is incredible . Compared to the other Terminator films however I was expecting more . It always seems that it would be the new director 's point of view on how it really should be . I think the new director did a good job on this film . Kudos .",m,1
"Great movie , everything I expected for a continuation of the Terminator story , and then some . Very well done . Highly entertaining . The ONLY flaw is when they introduced Arnold S 's terminator model T101 ? . . . it was clearly computer generated and looked a little fake , but not too bad . Humans ARE hard to do in CG , so . . . That aside , this was a GREAT movie .",m,1
"This is a great addition to the Terminator series . Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California Los Angeles , San Francisco , places in between But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design . You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron did n't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day . T-1s , T-600s , T-700s , T-800s , Hunter Killers , Moto-Terminators , The Harvester , you name it . . . this movie has it . Now actorwise , Christian Bale The Dark Knight as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines , very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father , Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin Star Trek . Then . . . finally . . . Sam Worthington Avatar as Marcus Wright . . . oh my god . . . I tell you , if Sam Worthington did n't play this role I do n't know who would have . In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother , he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments . He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot , Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood Street Fighter and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times . You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated . This talented aussie actor really did a break out role in this film and is my personal favorite character . This film has non stop action , amazing actors , and great effects to make this personally one of the best Terminator films yet .",m,1
"I was reading some bad reviews about this movie , and I was a bit amazed . The CGI to me it was pretty good , at least I liked it better than the Terminator 3 CGI . . . Some people said it had many plotholes but I really did n't see them , we did n't know much about the story about Kyle and John becoming a leader , etc . . . Some of the reviews I read were also complaining for things they either did n't understand or did n't pay enought attention , or simply did n't know some things and just criticized for the sake of it . One HUGE mistake that I notice constantly that people make , is when they go to see a movie with a preovious expectation . . . If you go to see a movie thinking it 's going to be awesome or at least thinking it might be similar to `` something '' you 're probably gon na exit the theater dissapointed . . . As how it happens if you do n't know what to expect of a movie and you end up liking it sometimes you go see a movie thinking it will suck and when you finish it , you keep thinking the same , but that 's just the mistake of going to see that movie with a fixed expectation of failure Overall I liked the movie , the acting was n't anything amazing , but it was enough for this movie , and the story of Marcus I found it to be interesting and well adapted into the idea of the movie . Finally , I think that people who went to see this movie and did n't like it is because they were expecting another terminator , like the previous ones , or simply was expecting to be dissapointed and got what they hoped for , but still it 's a good story , maybe not a huge story , but an important part of the mythology IMO , it added new things to our knowledge , it confirmed others and just played with information we already knew just for the viwer 's pleasure . . .",m,1
loved this movie . this is one of those that 'll stay in my collection . cant wait for the next one .,m,1
"I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE RECIEVED THE SHORT END OF THE STICK , ITS MY FAVORITE TERMINATOR MOVIE . GREAT ACTING , ANTON YELCHIN , BRICE DALLAS HOWARD , MOON BLOODGOOD , CHRISTIAN BALE , SAM WORTHINGTON , GREAT ACTORS , , STORY & MCG DID AN AWESOME JOB . I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE ANOTHER . . . BUT MOST LIKELY NOT IT TOOK OVER 2 YRS TO COME OUT . SOMETIMES PEOPLE CANT GET OVER THE ORGINAL , I HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS MOVIE & RELISE JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS",f,1
"Actually , I 've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas . The ONLY place I found it Director 's Cut , Digital Copy was on Amazon .",f,1
"I found this movie to be very good , especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future . Bale , Yelchin , and Worthington give excellent performances . The action and special effects are great . The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film . Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately , but they forget that it has always been Skynet 's goal to kill Connor , not Reese , and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor 's father .",m,1
"This DVD is heavy on the special effects and light on the plot . Having seen all of the terminator movies , there has been a downward spiral since `` The Governator '' left the scene . Given the economic state of California , who knows , maybe he will `` be back '' as promised . On the other hand , Terminator the TV Series is excellent . Much better than the movies . The scripts are written very well with a great deal of novel ideas worked into the plot that are technologically sound . For example , the notion that sophisticated traffic management systems could be the precursor to the terminator 's nervous system was an inspired parallel . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001AQO43M '' > Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season < a > < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001AQR3J4 '' > Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season [ Blu-ray < a > ] The writers of the TV series have clearly done their homework as well as providing creative plot lines that hold the viewer 's attention any loyalty . The movie scripts are , for the most part hack jobs with Terminator Salvation serving as an arch-typical illustration . The whizzbang is fine , but there needs to be a bit more substance behind the plot .",m,0
"For Terminator Fans , of which I am one , this was an entertaining movie . It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening . It was the best of the recent man vs . machine genre movies . There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things .",m,0
"I was disappointed in this sequel , tho the special effects and most action was terrific . The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me . The ending was predictable early on , and was a clone of `` I Robot . `` The film 's monotone coloration was depressing , and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls huh ? and skeletal teeth they eat hot dogs ? The attempt to weave in Arnold S . at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick Terminator 2 felt disjointed and like an afterthot . Save your money .",m,0
"Well , the movie was fun and it was great to see Arnold , well kinda , back as the character that started it all . The movie is well worth watching and the picture is awsome . The so called director 's cut , leaves alot to be desired . The rating is changed to an `` R '' because of 3 minutes that are lame and could have been more . We see a all to brief view of Williams breast , and , I do mean brief and from the side . This does NOT improve the movie or add anything to the plot . I am happy that this version came with the set , if , I bought this version for the extra scene it would have been a big let down . I hope that a version with more extra scenes is released soon .",m,1
"This was one of the best terminator movie yet , evryone play their part and it was just a sit down and enjoy yorself type moive , I Recommend this movie to anyone that like action pack and hold on to the edge of your set movie .",f,1
"I keep seeing a lot of people calling the 3rd movie `` campy '' , and the 2nd `` the best '' . I think these are just everyday movie goers saying things like that . Fans of the series who like action will like T2 the best , but fans more into horror say the 1st will never be beaten . Terminator : Salvation will be closer to the first film than the other two . I like this movie more than the 2nd and 3rd . The 2nd has the James Cameron aura around it that has everyone charmed . And even though the 3rd was filled with action and `` over the top '' machine on machine battles , it comes in 4th . I still wake up from nightmares of a blown in half Terminator crawling after me where ever I am , so the first is 1st on my list . Terminator : Salvation is full of the things that will only make my nightmares worse . James Cameron zombies are giving this movie low ratings to keep it down . If you are more of a fan of the First Terminator , this one might make you feel good .",m,1
"I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation , and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out , it has all the future scenes from Terminator , T2 , and T3 . This was a radical movie . I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created . I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights . it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold 's face , as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies . it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright , but did not shoot at him , because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg . it did n't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie , because I got a good thrill out of it none the less .",m,1
"As expected , the special effects were , well , special . Unfortunately , after the special effects , there apparently was not enough money left to pay for a 14 year-old to point out the glaring errors in the script - my favorite was when the 6 story-tall robot that shook the earth when it walked and was accompanied by a jet plane , snuck up on the people in the desert quick-trip . The script also failed to close the loop and send Kyle back to save Sarah . The basic problem is that somebody other than James Cameron was allowed to direct the sequel Terminator movies . The second one was not terrible , but the T3 and Salvation were way off from what they could have been .",m,0
"This movie never really never got the credit it deserved at the box office . This is a really good action flick . My husband said it was the best movie he 'd seen in a long time and we watch a lot of movies . It 's got non-stop edge-of-your-seat action , and I thought Christian Bale was GREAT as John Connor . Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this , too . If you read the reviews , you 'll see what 's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people do n't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version , but not the regular dvd version . This movie gets five stars from me .",m,1
many of the old fan hates this movie . I am young fan and like the war of future . terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan . There so much to take advantage of . If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling . The moives does have it flaws like john Conner 's wound at the end . Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie .,m,1
"I saw this movie with my son , and it is nothing like the other movies but make a little bit of sense to me but I think it could have been a hell of alot better with fighting sequence and special effets . I understand why sam worthington is a terminator because of my states gov . not being able to film in it but yet they use the cg versiion of him , that was cool . on the other hand I think they should bring worthingtons caracter back for the next movie and give him more of a role as well as other cast members . and find someone other than christan bale . . . . .",m,1
"Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie . . . The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive . They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch . They lacked a passionate or fiery edge yes even in their vocies as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC ? Oh wait , Linda Hamilton 's voice was used . . . and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them . John Connor did nothing for this story , his parts could have been all in the background and it would n't of impacted the storyline in any way . Continuity and Common sense were ignored : Example 1 : The T-600 - Kyle Reese said they were covered in rubber skin , which made them easier to spot up close . Synthetic skin , hair , nails etc . being the last comestic improvements on the Terminator robots - turning them into cyborgs . McG the director probably thought he said they were easy to spot because they were 8 or 9 feet tall and had a minigun on one arm . The rubber skin on the movie T-600s was not a disguise at all . It was some rubber sheets draped over their head . I do n't honestly believe many pro-wrestlers are EVEN close to being that big or ugly so unless Skynet wanted to infiltrate a Wrestling Federation Organization it was doing things wrong in Terminator : Salvation . Example 2 : The giant machine which scoops up people from buildings like a fat man grabbing pop-corn . . . How the hell does something that large sneak up on paranoid people in the future ? Especially small communes in the middle of nowhere ? Was it wearing a rubber sheet with wrestling tights on ? It has been reported that when the director McG was asked about this film and how it 's not up to any kind of standards that he replied with `` it 's just a damn dumb summer action , terminator movie , it 's not supposed to be cerebral , it 's a pop-corn fantasy flick '' . No wonder Bill Murray punched him out once . If you hated T3 remember this about TS : The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris . From Wikipedia : Based on 250 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , critical reaction for Terminator Salvation tended toward negativity with an overall 32 % approval rating . Among Rotten Tomatoes ' Top Critics , which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers , websites , television and radio programs , the film holds an overall approval rating of 29 percent . By comparison , Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 52 , based on 35 reviews . At all three websites , the film ranked lowest among the Terminator franchise films .",m,0
"If you love the Terminator franchise . . . well , you 'd HAVE to love it to endure this mess . The first two flicks were awesome , of course . The third ? Not so much . T4 ? The downward spiral continues . Huge budget , talented actors and great story material are all majestically pissed away . The Charlie 's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares ? I did n't and that was the problem . Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes . Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences . Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood sp ? get to have a romance and why do we need this or care ? All of these people are extremely talented and again , the effects ? More or less spectacular . But I found myself apathetic . In the earlier films you found a stake in the characters and cared . With T4 I felt like I was watching a play by Max Fisher . Well done but just not the real deal .",m,0
"Well , there 's nothing like destroying a franchise , is there ? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood 's most beloved movies , remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron 's not even dead yet . I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment . Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020 . I knew from the beginning it did n't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he did n't try to direct a film . When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient , I knew we were in trouble . And then Sam Worthington showed up the Gene Hackman of our times , appearing in about 10 % of all films currently being made and could n't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot . Fortunately , it 's not too noticeable since Christian Bale 's Batman growl steals the show . If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films , one of the rules is that bullets do n't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out . In this film , it 's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel . Go figure . And that 's the most faithful this film gets to the originals . Then there 's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog `` Come with me if you want to live , `` to which the only response is `` If the rest of the film is this bad , I 'll stay here . `` Back to the bad and broken logic , Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that does n't make any sense . It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50 % Terminator too but by the time we find out , it 's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer . More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that 's incredibly bad at catching people . And then there 's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2 . 0 protocol survived the war . At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up , thankful that she 's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water . Apparently , Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and could n't bring herself to this horror show . I do n't really remember why she 's there . Anyway , plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie . They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm . Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic would n't win a chess game let alone Future War . The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry . There 's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened . So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job . Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing . As far as I 'm concerned , this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that 's the end of it . If you remember how thrilled you were when first seeing Terminator 2 , do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one . And I did n't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money .",m,0
"It 's difficult these days to please a sophisticated world audience . We 've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us , inspire us , make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained . Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that . IMHO , it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced . The acting is outstanding , the characters are endearing , compelling and artfully developed . Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor . Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence . Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction . The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry Star together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge . The special effects were first rate , along with the script , sound and pace of the movie . If you love sci-fi , you 're going to love this movie .",m,1
"Terminator Salvation2009 115 min . PG-13Synopsis : John Conner Christian Bale is fated to lead humanity 's war against the machines , but the arrival of a stranger , Marcus Wright , Sam Worthington alters the future of mankind . It had been six years since we last saw an installment to the Terminator franchise . That film , Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , was viewed as a `` disappointment '' . Since then , a lot had changed . Most notably , Arnold Schwarzenegger walked away from acting to become the Governor of California . So leading into a fourth film , many were concerned if there was even life to the franchise after Arnold . There was a lot at stake with Terminator Salvation , the fourth film in the popular franchise . The huge burden was inexplicably handed over to the Charlie 's Angels director , McG . As to be expected , the internet was aghast with the announcement . `` How could this guy be the one to carry on the franchise ? `` Soon after , fans seemed to cool down due to the signing of Christian Bale as John Connor . This casting decision , however , would cause serious havoc to the screenplay penned by Terminator 3 scribes John D . Brancato and Michael Ferris . Connor , who was originally conceived as a small , mystical figure was now required to be sprinkled throughout the entire film causing the characters of Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese Anton Yelchin to be diminished . Ultimately , this is where it all goes wrong for the film . The script had been raped and pillaged and devoid of what the fans would have expected with such a concept . All we get is wall-to-wall action with very little in between . Christian Bale , who is often cited as being 'terrible ' in this film , just simply has nothing really to work with and ultimately , the character of John Connor actually seems to be pretty pointless . The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard as his wife Kate . It often feels - as was the case - that these characters were shoehorned in with nothing for them to do . Sam Worthington , however , is really the only interesting thing about the movie . His character may not be great but at least he offers something . In fact , I would have loved to have seen more of the relationship between him and Reese be developed instead of the need for an explosion every two minutes . That is , however , the one good thing that could be said for the film . It certainly has some nice looking effects . The real problem here , as stated earlier , is the script . There 's nothing going on , and when there is , it becomes flat out illogical or it contradicts elements of the previous Terminator movies . They do try to appease the die-hards by infusing some nostalgia by incorporating Linda Hamilton 's voice , the CGI-Schwarzenegger and throwing in a sampling of the series ' classic theme , but despite it all , it never truly feels like a Terminator movie . Many may pin that on its PG-13 rating , but in honesty , an R-rating would n't have saved this one . And do n't even get me started on the film 's ending . Who the hell thought that was a good idea ? ! Overall , Terminator Salvation is essentially one loud , elongated action sequence that lingers on and on for nearly two hours . It 's poorly paced and erratically edited with no substantive dialogue or situations . It 's just a flimsy , unoriginal , forgettable film that would have been best left unmade .",m,0
"The Terminator franchise is an odd beast . Since the original 1984 feature , it has been sold to three soon to be four different production companies and two different studios . The only times the plot and dialogue have blended well together were in the first two movies , thanks to the care and writing skill of the younger James Cameron . Since then , the timeline , plot , and characters of Terminator have gone through mutations and minor changes , either to the delight or disappointment of fans usually the latter . For a franchise that does n't have millions of fans like Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica , Terminator still has legs . And Terminator Salvation was a great opportunity to tie some loose ends left over from the last movie and TV series , and reboot the franchise in the hopes of producing a John Connor trilogy . This film is either the first film of a second trilogy , or an intermediate movie while the future of the franchise goes up for bid in a Hollywood auction in 2010 . So how is this movie ? First the bad news . Some of the dialogue , as is the case in too many action films , is poor . I 've always believed movie producers should hire more than script doctors . They should hire an experienced screenwriter or playwright to give the dialogue a go-over . The plots are usually okay . But the words coming out of character 's mouths can always use an upgrade . Again , I look at Aliens as a model in how smart action movie dialog should be written . At least the dialogue in Terminator Salvation holds together for the first 20 minutes of the 117 minute director 's cut . Slightly less bad news - if the director prefers to be known as 'MCG ' Joseph McGinty Nichol , and whose previous works were the two Charlie 's Angels films , you know he 's going to spin his wheels and show-off a little bit . And MCG does . But he also proves for the first time that he is capable of assembling top-grade action sequences that are both thrilling and comprehensible unlike Christopher Nolan , who seemed incapable of directing a good action sequence in The Dark Knight , IMO . MCG seems to have done his homework . His attention to detail setting-up and executing action sequences is similar to the directors he grew-up with George Lucas , Brian DePalma , John Woo , James Cameron . If I were the executive producer , I would have wanted Alfonso Cuaron Children of Men to direct , or at least a director who did n't give himself a nickname . And finally , the movie does go off the rails a bit towards the end . The second half of the movie is poor and cliched . Christian Bale gets more screen time in the second half , but the final acts test the boundaries of medical and physical plausibility . Also the second half is weighed-down by b-movie explosions , obvious homages to the first two Terminator movies , and brief tips of the cap to The Matrix , Lord of the Rings , and Aliens not so brief with the last movie , as the entire climax seems to replicate Ripley 's Rescue . The first half of the film is clearly better than the second half . At least the two halves are bridged by a most impressive and original chase and battle sequence in which all the great elements of the film come together beautifully . That sequence is simply crackerjack . But everything else in the movie I see as good news , in varying amounts . Masio Kassar remained as executive producer from T2 and T3 and hired as much Terminator talent as he could - namely the editor and an apprentice of Stan Winston 's . The casting is fine . The photography , despite being handled by a disliked , unorthodox DP , is excellent , and matches the film 's bleak theme and outlook . The sound design is close to brilliant , with the machines sounding radically different from the previous three movies to awesome effect . Danny Elfman 's restrained score stays off the soundtrack during most action sequences , allowing the jet engines and explosions to speak for themselves . Art direction and costumes are all first-rate . Special effects are almost all top-notch , with the exception of a few cheap explosions and some of the aircraft shots . Some plot weaknesses and poor dialogue aside , this is a wonderfully bleak movie . Mankind is almost doomed . The machines are smarter and sometimes more brutal than the previous films . The machines are not always consistent in their speed hey they have to take their time to aim at our heroes , but they are always quick to destroy human vehicles before humans , and that is a very welcome bit of smart military strategy on their part . And some humans are fairly brutal as well . It 's tough for a studio to have a bleak movie as its summer tent pole , but that 's what Terminator Salvation was to Warner , which struck box office gold a year earlier with The Dark Knight . Terminator Salvation failed to crack the # 1 spot in its opening weekend . But it will be remembered for being the best Terminator feature in 18 years , and that is saying quite a lot .",m,0
"Nothing new happens in this movie . It has plenty of action , mostly in the form of explosions , but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward . The viewer goes out where he came in . Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer 's intelligence with lazy plot devices . For example , there are scenes involving the movement of massive , clanking machines , yet characters are n't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them . Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline , or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine . The movie is riddled with such devices . They play out , one after another , for about two hours . Nothing else happens . We learn nothing new . My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series .",m,0
while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically . the action is n't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top . you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you do n't assuming you 've seen the first 3 previously,m,1
I will be the 1st to say when I saw this in theaters I left with alot of questions . But with the maximum movie mode where McG pops up every now and then and explains things and tells you the thought process for alot of scenes I finally understand how this one fits the other 3 . Still I think only the true die hard fans of the Terminator movies will appreciate this movie .,m,1
"This movie is so massively wrong-headed , and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film , that I can only assume it 's deliberate . I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron 's 1984 classic . What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness ? Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018 , John Connor Christian Bale struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance . Marcus Wright Sam Worthington , executed by the state fifteen years earlier , awakes not one day older , already in the thick of fighting . But in a matter of hours , Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need : the current location of young Kyle Reese Anton Yelchin . The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us . Because many of us distrust ordinary technology , Cameron 's 1984 film is justly considered a classic . This film , by contrast , seems written as a showcase for the special effects . There is not one moment of tension , not one revealing human moment , not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth . This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces , fight sequences , and explosions . Everything is tightly so choreographed , I never get the feeling anything has really happened . If you doubt what I mean , I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold , head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts , tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee . Yeah , the whole movie is like that . Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other , better sci-fi movies . You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all . Beer for Star Wars , wine for The Matrix , liquor for Spielberg 's War of the Worlds . Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels . I saw not one original set piece , line of dialog , or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster . Cameron 's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever . The second film was good . The third was adequate . This one is awful . I do n't throw negative superlatives around , because they get abused , but this is the worst film I 've seen in at least three years . I will watch no more Terminator films . I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way .",m,0
"I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it . Unlike all the other films , it lacks a story , or even characters you care about . Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about . But the truly talentless MTV director McG and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes . One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike , it 's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie , especially since it is mostly shot in dark , grimy locales . Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart . Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about . Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous . So many holes there it 's hard to know where to begin . So here 's the deal . You like lots of explosions and fights -- go for it . Lots of that here . You want a movie that makes sense or has any sort of connection to the original Terminator movies , forget it .",m,0
Can someone tell me what this movie was about ? The plot if there WAS one was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again and have done in spite of Edward Furlong 's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor . There 's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED . One HUGE disappointment . Sorry - I WO N'T `` be back '' if this is the best they can do ! !,m,0
I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator `` Arnold Schwarzenegger . `` A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you have n't seen it .,m,1

"I am a huge fan of the Terminator series . The second movie being my personal favorite and also just my favorite movie of all time . 'Nuff said . That being said , it 's hard for me to watch a Terminator and be . . . impartial I guess you could say cuz I love this series so damn much . That first Terminator movie was incredible and you were really hoping to see more of the incredible story unfold . After Judgment Day , I would always wonder what the hell happened to the movies ? ! At the very least , there were plenty of Terminator comics you could follow . I never actually read them cuz I was just a kid and had no idea of there existence until more recently . . . I 've gotten side tracked . . . Uhhh I read Robocop vs Terminator though . That was awesome . OK back on track : Flash forward some 12 years I see a commercial for another Terminator movie . Well its about damn time . I saw it , thought it was dope few things coulda been done differently but I did n't care . The franchise had finally been revived . So all that side tracking and talking about movies and comics that have nothing to do with the rating of this movie brings me to . . . this movie . Terminator Salvation . As I was walking out of the theater , I thought it was an incredible movie and they did absolutely no wrong with it . We 're finally seeing what we 've been waiting to see since Kyle Reese talked about the future way back in the first movie . Now I got ta step back and attempt to impartiality . This is gon na be tough . . . OK visually ; stunning . Bale as John Connor ; I 've heard it before and I agree . His stoic acting needed to go somewhere . Nothing against him as an actor cuz I enjoy the stuff he 's done but I do n't feel like he portrayed John Connor the way he should have . Also , its got ta be rough hiding that accent and trying to act a certain way so I 'll just chalk it up to that . Ok , the story ; Yeah , it was pretty weak . Spoilers Exactly what I mean by that is that the machines knowing of Kyle Reese 's existence and even capturing him and not offing him that very second did n't make any sense . That would have been the end of everything right there . I have no beef with Marcus ' character either . Considering all the changes that happened in the past , it makes sense for something new to emerge in this altered future . It 's also cool cuz you have this guy who lost his humanity to Skynet and wants to take names because of it . I think that about covers it . Giving this movie 3 stars makes me feel dirty though . If it were possible to give it 3 and a half I would",m,0
This was a gift for my son-in-law forChristmas and I got it for a superprice because I pre-ordered it onAmazon as a gift . Thank you Amazon,f,1
"I 've watched this movie 3 times now and I must say I do enjoy the action part of the movie , that being said some of the script could have been much better , some of the lines delivered are just ridiculous . for example the character Marcus delivers a line `` So that 's what death taste 's like '' after kissing the Doctor in the beginning of the movie was very corny . Also there are some major issues when Marcus meets Kyle Reese , didnt Kyle find it odd that Marcus wasnt aware of why he didnt know about `` Judgement Day '' he never questions that ? The movie was drivin more for action than character development . . so if you keep that in mind you can still enjoy the movie . The DVD quality is as follows : Picture is very good even in most of the darker scenes , and the digital grading used to make most of the movie look greyish is well done . The sound dept for the Dolby Digital 5 . 1 Mix is excellent , great use of surrounds and Subwoofer which should be expected with an Action movie . In closing I hope the next Terminator movie has some better lines and character development , I enjoyed the Marcus character , but felt it could have been better . So leave your brain on off and just watch the movie and enjoy",m,0

"I am a fan of the Terminator saga . Terminator 2 : Judgement Day was the best movie of the series . This film is certainly better then part 3 . The DVD displays everything you saw in the movie theater . Unfortunately , there are no extra features on this disk . I was disappointed when I could n't watch any deleted scenes . This product is good for one who just wants to watch the basic movie , but the dvd will not satisfy serious fans .",m,1
Loved this movie . I was expecting the worst but this terminator movie is runner up to the original only .,m,1
"A terminator that is not advertise the star of the show , but really brings the story in a better level than the other terminators . To all of these people Bravo ! ! ! GOOD JOB .",m,1
"I thought the movie was decent , but I was very impressed on how fast it arrived after I placed my order .",f,1
"I guess I really dont get why so many ppl trash this movie , sure it 's not perfect how many are ? , but it is a great action movie in my opinion and I was entertained by it . I like many of you am also a fan of the terminator series and yes I know T2 rocked and was the best . Is it b c Arnold is no longer there , except in the cgi form which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out or perhaps b c James Cameron did n't direct it ? Personally I judge it on its own accord new actors new director rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies . I liked Mr . Bale as Connor , he did a pretty good job . I liked the story line w Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet . The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern futuristic feel to it which is cool . Although I wish the movie was longer , 1 hr 45 minutes approx . just seems too short in my opinion , it would 've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development . I dont like the clean PG-13 rating . I would like it to be more violent , bloody , gory , gritty , etc . staying true to a real war situation . Overall , I 'm glad they made this movie , it gives the series new legs , and I look forward to more .",m,1
"Christan Bale gives a outstanding genuine heart felt performance as John Connor . I also enjoyed the fact that they had a half human half terminator in this film . The coolest thing besides that is a CGI cameo by Arnold Swartzeneger in the final act of the movie . The special effects were sweet as well as the stunts and robotics . Anton Yelchin was really good as teenage Kyle Reese . This was a genuine portrayal of the future war against machines . The picture is okay for what picture the format can produce . The other thing that bothered me was the fact that this dvd version does not include the `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie . I would also like to point out that the dvd has absolutely no extras . The Blu-ray version of the movie not only includes the `` Director 's cut '' but other extras that talk about how they did stunts and effects for the movie . The `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie is 3 minutes longer and includes a nude scene in the rain of Moon Bloodgood , more blood in the scene where men attempt to rape her , and a tension building scene between Christian Bale and Michael Ironside in which `` General Ashdown '' puts a gun to John Connor 's head . I prefered the `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie because it lent more to the story emotionally and visually . Also to those who think there is no difference between `` Blu-ray '' and `` Dvd '' you need to get some glasses morons . It offers 6x the resolution that `` Dvd '' produces , and you get a much more crisper detailed picture . The difference is mind blowing considering it is a increase in resolution of `` 720x480i '' to `` 1920x1080p . `` You would have to be an idiot to not consider buying a `` Blu-ray '' player if you own a `` HDTV '' . DVD is fine if you have a tube tv but it is so blury and nasty on a `` HDTV . `` The Bottom line is Terminator Salvation is better on Bluray . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001FB55HQ '' > Terminator Salvation Widescreen Edition < a >",m,0

"When I think of the `` Terminator '' film franchise , two things immediately come to mind : an iconic leading actor like Arnold Schwarzenegger who can carry the film , and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up . This film , by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline , ensures a successful fourth installment . Basically , in `` Terminator Salvation '' , we finally get a glimpse into the future , where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor Bale are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time . While the war rages on , Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his and mankind 's entire existence . Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon . . . a `` terminator '' who thinks he is a human , throwing Connor and his gang for a loop . Though not a classic film in any sense of the word , I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at . . . the human resistance against Skynet . The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project , and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show , and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things : preview the `` terminators '' of the future , and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor . Plus , I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise , such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale 's own twist on the iconic `` I 'll be back '' line . Thus , although I feel that this film could have been much more epic , it was , as a fan of the Terminator franchise , entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end . It also sets the stage for a possible sequel , which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next `` Batman Begins '' , or instead turn into `` Superman Returns '' .",m,1

"I barely remember the Terminator movies , so the impact was less harmfull onwatching terminator salvation . I was'nt really looking for a continuation of thefranchise , i just wanted to be entertained . And that 's what this movie does . I found the movie had great effects , good sound and some great robots . Thecharacters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent . I find itsoo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end . . . but a must for the movie . A keeper . . . good to watch multiple times .",m,1
"great pic that fills the gap , and like the other films has the terminator as the savior",m,1
"I really wanted to like TERMINATOR SALVATION . In fact , after the first few scenes , I thought I would . But fate was not going to be kind to me on that count . First , what went right there will be spoilers : [ a ] Future War - you get to see what it is like for the survivors of J-Day to actually fight the machines . [ b ] Opening sequence - from Marcus getting the needle to the attack on the R & D facility , the image quality , action , characters and plot actually started to work for me . [ c ] Warthogs - any movie that includes the A-10 is worth watching . [ d ] Skynet Central - it looked both technologically advanced , as well as kind of primitive . [ e ] Human Prisoners - the reaction of John Connor to the prisoner issue was believable and worked as a motive for insubordination . Now , for what went wrong : [ f ] The War Against the Machines - viewers did not get to see many details about this all-encompassing conflict . Did you see any soldiers ' banter during down time ? Burials ? Chaplains ? Did you see any of their supply chain ? I mean humanity was nearly wiped out . Where do they get their food , fuel , ammunition , spare parts and communication gear ? I mean , the amount of screen time needed to clarify this is minimal ; a couple of conversations between characters about such things could make all the difference between plausible and hard-to-swallow . [ g ] Arnold - did we really need to see CGI Arnold ? I mean , the story has to stand on its own , and inserting him was a waste of time and effort . He could have been in a background shot of the management of Skynet before J-Day and that would have worked ; but he did not need to be in the movie . [ h ] Marcus - he should have been driven to the brink of insanity by all that happened . He was on DEATH ROW one minute , and then in the middle of what looks like a cross between Antietam and the Tet Offensive . I 'd be nearly bonkers . Would n't you ? [ i ] Marcus ' plug-in - When Marcus connected to Skynet and learned all about J-Day , why did n't he react more visibly than he did ? Why did Skynet take the personae of Connor , Reese and Dr . Serena Kogan , when it could have taunted him w the memories of his dead brother ? [ j ] Skynet is Omniscient , 1 - how in the world could Skynet have known that Kyle Reese should be targeted for elimination ? It seemed like a distraction to me , making ONE KID the focus of their efforts . [ k ] Skynet is Omniscient , 2 - why did Skynet develop an obsession with John Connor so early ? It would be like making the focus of World War One not to defeat Germany but to take out Corporal Adolf Hitler . Had the writers any common sense , Skynet would have targeted Connor FOR HIS EXPLOITS ON THE BATTLEFIELD . A bit of dialog could have covered that easily . Try this on for size : General Ashdown : `` You really got their attention hitting their factory two years ago , and the ammo dump last month ; now all I see on the intel reports is that they want your head on a stick '' John Connor : `` It 's what I was born to do '' [ l ] The Signal - too easy , and Connor should have known this ; if Ashdown had said that his boys put together a VIRUS that MIGHT shut them down , and it needed to be tested , that would have been a bit more believable . [ m ] John takes a dive into treacherous waters - Although it worked for me that the Commanders were on a sub , did Connor really have to take a dive into the Perfect Storm ? Did anyone on the production team ever hear of hypothermia ? [ n ] White Hat Wipeout - In many movies and TV shows , it seems to be a popular notion to kill all of the hero 's forces , to reinforce the hopelessness of the situation . In TS all of the Resistance fighters get waxed except for Character Shield Connor NEEDLESSLY . Had the writers put in a big gun battle that would have been much more enjoyable , and advance the notion that the war is WINNABLE . Example : Connor 's team gets pinned down by two groups of T-600 's , calls in an air strike , and a medevac . In the middle of it all , the hackers get their data , and fight their way back to beaten-up Huey with Common as a door gunner mowing down any metal that came their way . After dropping off the wounded @ the infirmary , the hackers then PRESENT their findings to command , with Connor ready to add his two cents about the new machines . See how simple it is to describe an action sequence and the aftermath ? [ o ] Marcus meets Connor - who in the world wrote that dialog ? Why even mention Kyle Reese ? I found it to be too Deus-Ex-Machina for my taste . They did not follow the 'show do n't tell ' rule of film making . [ p ] Climactic battle - only ONE T-800 was available for action ? I mean this is SKYNET ; they have countless machines available for use . Oh , and I did n't know that John Connor 's heart and lungs had WOLVERINE 'S mutant healing power . I mean a few gun shots could have more believably imperiled his life , and it would have made Marcus 's sacrifice needless . [ q ] Heart Transplant - the notion that a heart transplant can be performed IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT is a bit of a stretch for my small , reptilian mind . But not the geniuses behind their Clark Novas . All in all it was good , but not up to 'Terminator ' or 'T2 ' standards , but better than 'T3 . ' And , do n't get me started on Fox 's cancellation of the TV show 'Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . ' Arguably one the best Movie-to-TV adaptations EVER but it had ZERO continuity w TS . Now if only James Cameron , or Joss Whedon were to actually obtain the rights , and do something worthwhile with the franchise . There 's still life in it , but it needs to be nurtured . I have ranted enough - please rate my review even if you think I 'm a complete idiot . moneybagzz out .",m,0
"While this is no T2 the best in the franchise , in my opinion , Salvation is at least better than T3 which was a ham-fest . This provides a different view on the Terminator series in the sense that it does take place in 2018 . I went in to this movie with little or no expectations because of the bad reviews and came out pleasantly surprised . It 's a decent film . I would and have watch it more than once . What this says for my intelligence is questionable as it seems to be made with someone with a low IQ but sometimes these mindless-fun popcorn movies end up being the best guilty pleasures .",m,1
"It 's saving grace is that it did have a plot and it did sync up pretty well with the other 3 Terminator movies , but it could have been so much better , especially with an actor like Christian Bale staring in it . I 've really enjoyed all of his movies and tried so hard to like this one as well . It was filled with CGI , most of it fair to bad as well as goofy things that no human could ever survival , like a helocast from a pretty decent altitude at a high rate of speed that John Conner performed and did n't even get wet in the process . The plot was overcast by almost non-stop action in an apparent attempt to hide it , which is a real shame , as the plot is a noble one . The ending was unsurprising as well . Of course we all know that John Conner has to survive or the other movies in the franchise would n't make sense , but there was only one surprise to the whole thing and that card should have been played closer to the end so that boredom would n't set in before it thankfully came to an end .",m,0
The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie . I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen . That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action . I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action . The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox ' that brings the `John Conner ' guy into existence . How he sent his father back to his mom . And if he does n't do this then he will not `be ' . Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing . I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion . Just do n't expect any action . It 's not a `fun ' kill em ' all kind of film ; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip .,m,0
"You will not recognize the actors , or so little . Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated . The film does not bring much new data . It seems to be mixing time periods , but it does not matter . The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots , partly human brain and heart , etc and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance . They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators . Logical but not revolutionary , my dear Watson , or is it Sherlock Holmes , I was going to say Shakespeare . Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave . Interesting but only experimented at local level . The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines , and recognizable as such by them , but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet , the network that controls all the machines , liberate the prisoners there , have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger , escape with Kyle Reeves , a key to the future and destroy the place , which is a `` given back '' for a `` given gift '' because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco , a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen , but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their taskforce to clear the place in one big airstrike . This episode , that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation , ends with the hybrid being , Marcus Wright , giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds . That human touch , quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that 's its main objective . A few tears please . But all together the story has not advanced a lot , except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation . But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them , which would explain the relative flop of this film . It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss , at least to the brink of it . When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators , I am amazed . This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge . I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society , and to point out to me the child a wolf child I guess , since so far wolves do n't have TVs and smart phones who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school . These fake social-climbing-and-politically-minded-though-not-politically-correct-except-with-Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class , and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school , and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities , first of all smart phones . Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating . This ideology is behind the Terminator series , but it is today very pass & eacute ; , very pre-historical , if history started with the GUIs Graphical Users Interfaces . A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s . What an ignoramus . I would have sworn the Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland , California , in the fall 1969 , and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh , and then by Microsoft with Windows 3 . 1 , both at the beginning of the 1980s . Why should we be afraid of machines ? The Matrix was a lot more positive on the subject , even if the tale needs a human sacrifice , a Savior of sorts to conquer peace with machines and to rebut for a while the engineering mind behind it all , behind all the Mr . Smiths of this world . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",m,1
"Despite some strong acting , this is n't much of a movie . The next day I could n't remember how it ended . But that 's not what I want to focus on . I want to talk about the DVD , not the movie itself . This pertains to the single-disk widescreen regular DVD edition . There are only two choices you have on the main menu : `` Play Movie '' and `` Languages . `` No special features . No scene selections . Scene selection is a standard function of every DVD I have seen in the last decade . How could it not be included on this disk ? ? Even worse is the inescapable previews and ads . This is one of the nastiest tricks studios can put on a DVD . It is an insult . Movie previews and ads for video games and graphic novels start playing when you insert the disk . You can not escape them . Press the menu button and you will see something like `` This action prohibited in this disk . `` Try to jump through them quickly with the Chapter button and you will see the same thing . You ca n't get away from them until they 're finished . The ONLY thing you can do is go Fast Forward . You still ca n't get rid of them , you still have to see them , but at least it 's a little faster . Years from now if you want to watch this movie on this DVD , you will still have to sit through trailers for movies and products that are then old and probably forgotten . You want to kick the studio exec who thought this would be a good marketing tool . We should boycott the purchase of this DVD to protest the sleazy marketing techniques of the studio .",m,0
"Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series the first one and having seen the sequels ; I set my expectation levels very low for this one ; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream . I have to say . . . I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be . I do n't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I 've ever seen in any movie . While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy , I would have to agree only with the editing . The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character . If you know your T- Series movies . . you know what I am talking about . Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment , Arnold coming back sort of as the original terminator which looked so real . They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984 . Even the scar on John Connor 's face which is in a future scene on T2 was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator . Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch . I have to compliment the actors as well . I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese . Although , I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie 's story line . This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie . I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie , even though it 's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating . I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series .",m,1
"The Good : Special effects are in general excellent . Sound design is great if you have a home theatre set-up . I liked the performances of Sam Worthington 's and Anton Yelchin and there were a couple of nice little homage 's to the first two films - the `` come with me if you want to live '' line and the nod to Guns and Roses . The Bad : Christian Bale - now I know his performance has split the Amazon critics , for me it did n't really work . I found his performance very wooden and he exhibits none of the charisma that I would expect a leader of a resistance movement to have . The Plot - in a nutshell there 's too many holes . We never really find out what motivates the Sam Worthington character . He emerges from the ground and starts walking - he tells Kyle Reese that he 's heading north - for what ? - it 's never explained . And why for example does Skynet need to lure John Connor to its base - surely , if it just killed Kyle Reese then Connor would not exist anymore -the film is a bit sketchy on the whole time travel , cause and effect thing anyway . And given that Skynet is using Reese to lure Conor , the whole premise behind Sam Worthingtons character becomes a bit redundant . I know that at its heart it 's just a big dumb action movie but I like my dumb action movies make some kind of sense - at least in the context of their own universe . Oh , and John Connor 's wife must be one of the most underwritten characters I 've ever seen - she literally adds nothing to the movie . In summary , it 's not a bad movie - it 's certainly better than T3 , but it really does n't stand up to comparison with the first two movies in the franchise .",m,0
"Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation , one of which is much more interesting than the other . Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements , but a later writing team could n't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense . The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood , as well as Yelchin , and is the more interesting of the two . The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film , and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we have n't before . The second movie stars Christian Bale , and is not nearly as interesting . In many ways , John Connor is essentially along for the ride . I do n't understand this , given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance , and a charismatic leader ; you 'd think he 'd be the focus of the movie . Bale 's Connor is bland and unapproachable , through no fault of Bale ; the script gives him very little to work with . On the bright side , there is n't much here that 's going to tick you off if you 're a fan of the Terminator movies , unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV . On the down side , after it 's over , my reaction was `` huh , so that was it , `` instead of , `` that was really cool . `` When a movie with killer robots , time travel , Helena Bonham Carter , a nuclear war , and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response , it has failed in its mission . This is fine as a rental , but I would n't add this to my permanent collection .",m,0
"Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines . John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form . Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams , `` Noooooo ! `` Lots of fighting . Stuff blows up . Machines buzz . Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day . Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there 's no prize for the winner . It 's just two hours of stuff grinding together .",m,0
"I 'll start out by saying that I love The Terminator franchise , concepts , and basically the universe of ideas that Cameron spawned within his mind a long time ago . However , I must say that there were only two things that stopped this review from getting one star rather than two . One being that Christian Bale was in this movie , as he is one of my favorite actors , however is performance here was lacking . The second would be the special effects which were very well done . The rest of the movie though basically sucks , as did T3 . The rest of the cast sucks , even B . D . Howard , and they give a third rate performance . And the plot ? Do n't get me started . Where is the continuity here ? Fox 's `` The Sarah Connors Chronicles '' keeps continuity more in line , stemming from T2 . T3 sucked so bad that it does n't even count . Thank God for special effects and Bale , or this film could have been T3 part two . We can always think . . . what could have been . Peace and Love , Jake",m,0
Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited ! Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly !,f,1
"I have really liked the the first three movies , even the goofy third . This one was difficult to follow . The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects . However , the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting . It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese , they were n't . Not really . Then , we have the end . I felt it was straining for some deep moral ethical statement , but just struck me as empty , loose and amateurish . I think it 's really time to Terminate this series :",m,0
"John Connor could not prevent Judgment Day from happening ; he could only delay it . Now the war has arrived , and John Christian Bale , along with his wife Bryce Dallas Howard and any other surviving humans they run across are part of the Resistance , a group fighting for survival against the machines . Marcus Sam Worthington is part man , part machine , a rejuvenated murderer who was put to death before Judgment Day . The machines created him to combat the Resistance , but his human soul makes him loyal to that side of himself . After sneaking into a base , John Connor orders him to be destroyed , but an amorous female Moon Bloodgood helps him escape . Marcus barters with John ; he will infiltrate Skynet to save Kyle Reese Anton Yelchin , John 's father . As a stand-alone movie , Terminator Salvation is a mediocre action movie which follows a formula set up by others of the genre . It has exciting moments , its predictable moments , and boring stretches . However , as a member of the Terminator series , it is incredibly disappointing , and has such a different mood , it stands out like a wrong note . Somehow the post-apocalyptic world does not seem as scary and desolate as it did in Reese 's flashbacks in T1 . There is too much daylight in this movie , and the Resistance has too many resources . Furthermore , these actors ' renditions of famous lines from the previous films come out cheesy and cheap , like the film makers just threw them in to keep fans happy . There are also several continuity problems . How does Alice in Chains begin playing in the Jeep after Marcus hot wires it ? I find it hard to believe that a CD , let along a car , survived the nuclear explosions , but lets just assume they did . How , then , does Guns and Roses play over the radio when there is n't a radio station around to broadcast it ? Also , how did Sarah Connor 's tapes survive Judgment Day ? I found it annoying too that they 've been re-recorded , although audio obviously exists of them from previous films . I find it rather annoying that the cast changes with each film ; maybe the film makers should take a hint when all of their stars refuse to reprise their roles . The characters seem very shallow in comparison to the previous films . We have spent years getting to know them , John Connor particularly , and suddenly he 's completely different , a hardened shell of who he used to be . Bale plays the part like he never saw the other movies in the series , which is made all the more obnoxious because he is a celebrated `` Method '' actor . His involvement seems is a gross miscasting . The most fascinating character is Reese , who is a bit of a mystery anyway , but if a sequel is made and I hope one is n't , let 's hope Reese is the focus .",f,0
"One of the best movies to come out of 2009 , Terminator Salvation was exactly what the franchise needed to reinvigorate itself . 2003 's Terminator 3 did for this franchise what the Maginot Line did for France in WWII : Nothing . In fact , I 'd hazard to guess the Maginot Line was at least a passive failure while Terminator 3 fell more along the lines of `` Is there any possible way I can remove my rectum through my mouth ? `` type of epic failure . Thankfully , Terminator Salvation rectifies this . While not as action packed as its three predecessors , we are finally introduced to John Connor , whose very existence has been the crux of the Terminator dogma . Exploring the initial structure of the human resistance , and its looming possibility of schism , truly gave one a sense of the scattered and desolate nature of humanity . It also showcases a stage in the ever-changing evolution of Skynet and its slow , rumbling path towards human extinction . Skynet is n't everywhere yet and the resistance , while holding out , still lacks the momentum , and personnel , to truly strike any critical blows against its AI antagonist . This sets up a very well-written story and poses the question `` What truly makes us human ? `` The Blu-Ray transfer enhances the visual and audio experience and makes this installment a new and worthy torchbearer for the franchise . I would highly recommend this title to anyone .",m,1
"I saw Terminator : Salvation in theaters and I was extremely disappointed in how the origional story line that James Cameron created , went right down the toilet . Here are the major issues I have with this movie : 1 . In Terminator 2 and even Terminator : The Sarah Conner Chronicles , Sarah ALWAYS told John to run when he saw a machine . He is too important for the future . What do they have John doing in this movie ? They have him on the front lines hunting the machines . 2 . Who is the leader of the human resistance ? John Conner . Why is he reporting to superiors and taking orders from them ? Who fricking knows . John should be giving orders , not taking them and having others report to him . 3 . Who is John 's father ? Kyle Reese . Do the machines know who John 's father is ? According to the first film , NO . All records were destroyed during the nuclear war , the machines had no clue who Conner 's father was , but yet somehow Reese 's name ends on the top of a list that the machines are targeting for termination . Then the machines find Reese , but do n't terminate him . WTF ? If the machines aquired their target , they would have terminated him ASAP , they would not have taken him to the work slave farm . 4 . For those that have see Terminator 3 , towards the end John asks the T-800 Arnold why he was n't alive in the future and that his wife sent the T-800 back . The responce was : because of the emotional connection John had with the T-800 model when he was younger Terminator 2 he infiltrated his base and killed John . Now in Terminator : Salvation John faces the new T-800 model , with a digitally imposed Arnold body . Does John die ? No , he lives , but the laws of physics are completely shattered during the fight . John shoots a hole in a basin that has melted metal in it . It 's pretty much molten lava . It spills on the T-800 and completely covers it , but the T-800 survives and contines coming after John . Wait a minute , did n't a T-800 and the T-1000 get destroyed in melted metal at the end of Terminator 2 ? Major screw up there if you ask me . Anyway , back to T4 , the T-800 is after John , so he shoots a pipe , it bursts and splaches liquid nitrogen on it . The T-800 is frozen , but not defeated , because it breaks free and continues after Conner . Ok , so let me get this straight , the T-800 is covered in molten lava then frozen very quickly after and it can still move ? Highly unlikely . If you know anything about going from extreme heat to extreme cold , especially with metal , it explands , then contracts and becomes brittle . So the T-800 would have been stuck because the joints would not have been able to move and Conner would have had an easy victory by beating the head and destroying the chip . There are to many continuity issues from the origional James Cameron films that just do n't follow into this forth installment . As far as I 'm concerned , this forth film does n't belong in the story line . If they continue with the series , they need to fix the errors they made otherwise , they will just ruin it for me .",m,0
What a great film ! Blu ray is awesome ! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra 's that give a great couple hours enjoyment .,m,1
"The movie gets one star only because I ca n't give it less . Transformers was Shakespeare in terms of writing compared to this crap . Was this written and edited by a 12 year old ? Or is this the mean mentality they think viewers have ? The previous Ts were enjoyable movies because they did n't expect a lot of you and you did n't expect a lot from them and they did not insult your intelligence -- they kept it simple . If you have n't figured it out in the first 10 minutes , the moment you see Michael Ironside you should have a clear idea of what you are in for . This movie sucks , simple as that . The writing is beyond poor , I am shocked this has been positively reviewed at all . Did people see a different movie than I did ? In this movie : everyone yells ; people do the stupidest things that make ZERO sense just to propel an action sequence or some ludicrous plot device ; every cliche you could ever groan about is crammed in at every conceivable opportunity ; the big monster robots come with a soundtrack from War of the Worlds -- complete with people collection cages yawn ; strangers will immediately give up precious food if you have a cute kid with you who conveniently carries a tummy pack overflowing with little 3M bandaids to put on the strangers little scratch so we feel their `` bond '' ; oh , and if said stranger comes up to you and takes your gun but wo n't tell you anything about them , by all means you should immediately take them to get a vehicle because they are so easily attainable , oh and if you by chance happen to turn on the radio ? well the first song that will come on will be something 'special ' to him ; and , finally do n't forget to ask him to be your leader , so what you have had no other dialogue between you and you do n't know anything about him and you live in treacherous times . . . I kept leaning over and asking : is this really this dumb ? Yes , it really was that dumb . Waste .",f,0
"I'v enjoyed all 4 films . The only thing I notice missing from Salavation was the pacing was off . The first 3 films yes , even the 3rd kept up that relentless , stalking , edge of your seat type pacing that the 4th film just lacked . In terms of quality of production , acting , effects , it 's top notch . It just does n't flow as well as the earlier films . So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films . Does n't mean I did n't enjoy it or thought it was bad . . . . . . . just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films . Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-RayI 'm looking forward to the next film . Bring it on !",m,0
"Boy , this got hammered by most critics . But I do n't know what the problem was - I know it 's pretty grim from start of finish , and it does n't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks . But I thought this was really well done , and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job , the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie , and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout . Besides , how can you not love a movie who 's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood REAL name , not her character ! I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale 's on-set rant ; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie , it 's pretty darn good !",m,1

THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT . CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR .,m,1
My family thought that this DVD was in a very good condition . Enjoyed it very much,f,1
"This is a better than average action film , but compared to earlier 3 , it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate , heroism , and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions , the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected , and Conor is , well , just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls , etc . Still , it is fun and the images are quite good at times . The acting is very strong with Bale , Yelchin , and Worthington . Oddly , Conor 's wife , who Danes so superlatively acted in T3 , is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done . Interestingly , I bought this as blu-ray , and I ca n't say that the picture , with the exception of a few images , is more than marginally better . There is no unmistakable , quantum improvement over dvds . REcommended . It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series . I 'd give this 3 . 5 stars .",m,0
"`` Terminator : Salvation '' is a worthy addition to the franchise , featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects , an engaging storyline , and strong performances . Speaking of the latter , Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man , ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future . Worthington balances `` butt-kicking '' with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale 's `` John Conner . `` `` Star Trek 's '' Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese , managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely `` overplayed '' in the Trek film . Welcome `` appearances '' are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way .",m,1
"I watched this movie , expecting a better storyline . There was less story and more special effects though . To me a movie is always a let down when that happens . I wo n't spoil it for you by telling you anything specifically in the movie . I will say that you can watch this without seeing any of the other terminator movies or The Sarah Connor Chronicles series and you will be able to follow with no problem . All in all I gave it 3 stars . Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie , as I have recently injured my back , and been laid up for over a week . Anyway , the movie is a great form of escapism , the action is almost non-stop as is the case with most terminator movies . I just wish there had been more to the storyline . It felt too gappy . Rod",m,0
"Great movie , great price . I really like the movie , I went to see it in theatres and then bought this one . The video quality is amazing and the movie is awesome . No regrets .",m,1
Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor ? I would have prefered a no name actor to play John Conner . The first time watching the movie I almost expected him to say I am Batman and throw a batarang or something . but other than this it is a great flick and follows well with the terminator line .,m,1
"Way to many people are trashing this movie for no good reason . This is a fine addition to the Terminator storyline . Set in the future after `` Judgment Day '' it follows John Connor leading the resistance . The movie is well written and well acted Worthington has serious potential and throws you the occassional curveball to keep you interested . The action is well done and cgi compliments it ! A must see for anyone who is a fan of the franchise . If this is your first exposure to it , you will find yourself looking for the other three movies a . s . a . p . MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS : A beautiful print with some eye popping sequences . Demo Disc potential . FINAL VERDICT : A MUST OWN .",m,1
"BACKGROUNDBack in the 80s I was n't a fan of the first Terminator movie and actually I was n't fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies at all . Years later I gave a chance to T2 and I was blown away . I thought that the movie was awesome and that they rescued the story . But then years later T3 came out and I was very disappointed . Now with Terminator Salvation I have mixed feelings . The movie and plot is essentially good and entertaining , but now I 'm convinced that T2 was `` an anomaly that went strangely great '' . PLOTOk , this is a summer action packed movie , if you are looking for that , you will get it . Explosions , killer robots , lots of action , etc . As long as I remember T3 , this is a very different story . On this movie , the world is at war against the machines kind of the war described in the Matrix trilogy , so if you ever imagined a prequel to Matrix , this could have been the script . As any other sci-fi movie that needs to show that humans are losing the war , is set in desert locations . This adds certain texture to images and overall aspect of the film . Just to give you an idea of the looks of this movie , the first thing that comes to my mind is Mad Max , the latest is Resident Evil : Extinction and a lot of other movies in between . PERSONAL COMMENTI have never been a hardcore fan of Terminator series , but I found this movie really entertaining and enjoyable . Hardcore fans will always complain about anything , but if you just want to sit back and relax 2 hours , this is for you . CASTChristian Bale is playing John Connor while Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a cameo appearance . Sam Worthington is introduced as a new character that links humans with machines . I thing that is all you need to know . The performances are solid for a sci-fi action film . MUSICAgain the T2 drums appear . They still sound great . Generally speaking the score is good . CONCLUSIONThis is good movie within its genre , intended for action sci-fi followers . It 's not definitive in the series but it 's definitively better than T3 . You will end enjoying it if you just sit back and relax .",m,1
"BLU-RAY 3 DISC REVIEW '' Terminator Salvation '' created high hopes for the salvation of this profitable franchise for the studio as well as for fans of the original films James Cameron made . While I was initially disappointed with the film and the major gaps of logic storytelling that dogs the film , there are a number of scenes that suggest a much better movie was steamrolled by studio interference , budget cuts and last minute rewriting . T4 had potential buried in it which makes the film all the more disappointing . Still of you set your brain on cruise control and just enjoy the ride it 's a mindless diversion although hardly in the same category as T1 or T2 much less the enjoyable but inferior T3 . SPOILERS IN MY PLOT SYNPOSIS : Marcus Wright Sam Worthington in a terrific performance that seemed destined for a better film decides to donate his body to a Cyberdyne researcher Helena Bonham Carter in an interesting cameo after he is executed for murder . He wakes up not in Hell but subjected to hell on Earth in the year 2018 . John Connor leads resistence fighters and discovers a weapon that they can use to destroy the machines and is given an order to test it . Wright encounters Connor 's father Kyle Reese . When he 's captured by Connor Christian Bale , Marcus discovers he 's a cyborg designed to trick find Reese and trick Connor . Marcus convinces Connor to reluctantly agree to partner up with him in rescuing Reese before he 's killed . END OF SPOILERS : The Blu-ray looks and sounds pretty darn stunning . The Blu-ray disc includes both the original theatrical cut and the first `` Director 's Cut '' more accurately called the `` R '' Rated Cut that McG submitted when the film was to be rated `` R '' Warner had McG trim 3 minutes from the film for a much more friendly PG-13 to attract more viewers . Why Warner could n't have just had a seamless branched version of BOTH films I 'm not sure . It would have been far more valuble to allow McG to integrate the 40 minutes of cut footage into the film fleshing out some of the characters . I suspect we 'll see that with some sort of `` ultimate '' edition later down the line . There are some clever tips of the hat to the first two movies , Cameron 's `` Aliens '' and other science fiction films . To me it appeared that this clearly was a labor of love enough if the finished film does not quite measure up . Also has a number of extras including the Maximum Movie Mode which allows McG to appear on screen in a visual commentary track that gives us behind-the-scenes footage , drawings and concepts for the film . We also get a number of brief featurettes that show us how the Rototerminators were created , how Arnie made his `` cameo '' it 's actually quite clever and the creation of the post-apocalpytic future we see . A mindless bit of entertainment that fails to live up to the potential of the first two films , TS has promise but fails to deliver on it due to last minute rewrites and studio interference . Still , the film has a strong cast , a number of memorable scenes and visual effects that hint at a much better film that was terminated prior to shooting release .",m,0
"I went to see this movie and actually liked it . I think it would have been a little better if they could have had Arnold in it someway beside the little computer generated version of him for a couple of seconds . As far as how McG is releasing this on DVD , I am not happy . Where is the 2 disc special edition for DVD ? I do n't have a Blu-Ray player , and I do n't plan on buying one anytime soon , but I like to get the special editions of movies on the DVD . Every other big movie this year has a 2 disc special edition on DVD , but not Terminator , WHY ? I was really looking forward to the extend version that McG had talked about , and in the beginning he did say he was making a special edition for DVD , but not when release time actually came around . I guess I will have to deal with regular movie .",m,1
"Not impressed . . . clearly the only motivation behind this movie was to make a buck off the popularity of the first three Terminator movies . . . by 15 minutes in I was waiting for it to be over . About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale John Connor . Seems all he did was scream the whole time . The twist w Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting , but not enough so to save the picture overall . There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching , but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown .",m,0
"The special effects are really good . Some of the story is good . But overall , it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators . The ending was corny .",m,0
"This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins . Confusing and disjointed , frequently frustratingly illogical , it comes out boring , even with allthe well-done CGI mayhem . Said mayhem is non-stop , becoming a mindless blur of disjointedhuman and robot body parts flying nowhere . After the first two in the series , this one is even more of a disappointment , fans should see this as a continuation of T3 ; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name . At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $ 9 . 99 . Small consolation .",m,0

"see it finished a few minutes ago , the action secuences are just great , the argument that connects this with the other three films is superb , the sarah connor picture , the records , Kyle Reese , and of course Arnold , Sam Worthington in deed is worth to watch as the human hybrid-terminator he rocks here much more than Avatar , however , hardly a heart transplant can take place in a tent , further that the surgery is performed by a veterinary ! ! ! . . . . mmmm talking nonsense . . . i give it 4 or 5 stars , nevertheless is a very good movie !",m,1
"The movie was great and all , but what happened to the extras Deleted Scenes , Bloopers , Gag Reel and other extras ? This was a bare bones release . If they are going to release a movie to DVD , they should have all the extras that the fans would like to have . What 's the deal on the digital copy ? Why should I have to log onto the Web to get my digital copy . I paid for a 2-Disc set , do I expect to have a DVD of the movie and a Digital Disc copy of the movie , not a coupon to download the digital copy . Let 's see that 's fraud in my opinion or disceptive practices . Wonder what the FCC would think about this ?",m,0
"Gads ! All the whining ! `` Terminator : Salvation '' did what it was supposed to do . ENTERTAIN ! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director 's cut , so the DVD did n't have extras . So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid ? `` Terminator : Salvation '' is first and foremost , a Sci-Fi film which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics , technical jargon , weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition , among others . All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing but it did n't stop any of the grousers from seeing it , anyway . The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor , meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet . I happen to like the `` new '' terminators and there were a bunch ! introduced , and the pace was lightning quick , meaning I had to watch certain segments over , to get full effect . Yes , the acting was two-dimensional at times , but this is a Sci-Fi Action film , and considering Schwartzeneggar 's portrayals in the first three films , not unexpected . Still , the film does n't suffer because of this . The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise . It 's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale , the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter , Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts . It 's sad , too , because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress ! The rest are relative unknowns , with maybe Anton Yelchin Alpha Dog and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions . Still , the performances were good . I wo n't go into specific details of the story , as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST , so as to lay it bare , thinking they were doing us all a favor . Suffice to say , `` Terminator : Salvation '' is as good a Sci-Fi Action film as you are likely to see , until maybe . . . . `` Avatar '' .",f,1

I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE LATEST DVD RELEASE OF TERMINATOR SALVATION DID'NT HAVE THE BONUS FEATURES ON IT . I DO N'T LIKE FACT THAT THE DVD SALES MARKETING IS SHOVING BLUE RAY DVDs AND THAT OBNOXIOUS SECOND DISC OF DIGITAL COPIES DOWN OUR THROATS . WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PAY EXTRA FOR A DIGITAL COPY DISC IF YOU 'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THE DVD MOVIE ONLY ? I ALWAYS BUY DVD WITH BONUS FEATURES BECAUSE IT GOES OVER HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE AND INTERVIEW WITH THE ACTORS AND OTHER MOVIE EXTRAS . THE DVD SALES MARKETERS ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THEY START AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS . AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED IT WAS GIVEN A 3 STAR RATING BY ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE BETTER . THE ACTION SCENES WERE TO A MINIMUM AND IT DRAGGED AT TIMES . I 'M A BIG TERMINATOR FRANCHISE FAN SINCE ITS FIRST RELEASE IN 1985 . I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD 'VE BEEN BETTER .,m,0
"I stopped reading the reviews after a while as I was getting tennis neck . I remember the same reactions to T3 - the purists hated it and the non-fans did n't get it . This is a popcorn movie . Check your brain at the door . It does n't make good use of the Terminator franchise for sure but complaining about what could have been is pointless . If you are a sci-fi or T fan this is a worthy bookend just for the visuals . If you are not very familiar with the T franchise this movie tries to stand on its own with a little narration . Ironically this movie does n't actually advance the Terminator mythology at all since it tries too much to stand by itself . In all cases I think there is something for everyone as long as you remember : this is n't an art film . Woulda coulda shoulda - does n't matter . It is done , this is probably the last movie since the Terminator rights are on the auction block now . Make peace with it . I liked it for what it was - did n't hate it for what it was n't . It 's a glass half full thing . . . ; -",m,1
"If you want to watch a cartoon , buy `` Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs '' or some other Disney animated feature . Or if you want to wander through a game landscape and shoot at robot spiders and flying machines , buy the `` Terminator : Salvation '' game . This DVD should be required to have a warning label like those found on cigarettes . To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement . The animation was of poor quality and the lip-synching for the two characters was non-existent . Even the old Japanese Gozilla and Mothra flicks were done better . Instead of displaying the film in one episode , it was broken up into 6 episodes -- each with beginning and end titles and credits . Hey . . I really enjoyed watching them over and over ad nauseum . If the episodes were different , it might have made this thing more interesting but it was one chase scene after another with the spiders and flying machines shooting endlessly at the two human characters . . . and never hitting them . It reminded me of those blackplotation flicks where the bad guys shoot at the black hero and never hit him while he shoots back and never misses the endless supply of bad guys . Was I disappointed ? Absolutely ! Why did I give it only a `` One-Star '' rating ? Because nothing lower was available .",m,0
"Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie . We finally get an entire movie based around the future war . Not only do we get to see the classic terminators , but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet . Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience .",m,1
"This movie is way out there . . . Not sure where they were trying to go with this movie but , I really ca n't wait till Arnold is no longer playing Governator and gets back to create another actual movie and this one is redone . I was looking to see Terminators such as Arnold , the T-1 's from the original movie , Summer Glau , and Kristianna Loken 's characters in it or at least similarities to them , there was n't . Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold , even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character . Outside of these nuances , the overall movie was good , just not a James Cameron movie and it shows .",m,0
I just do n't get the negative reviews . I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews . I finally decided to watch it last night . I was expecting a lousy flick . What a pleasant surprise . This movie is great . Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three . If you do n't like this movie you just ca n't appreciate originality and great action . 10 STARS OUT OF 10 !,f,1
"I was n't blown away by this installment of the Terminator series , but there was a lot to enjoy from the dirty visuals to the clever use of the original terminator body etc . The Director 's cut however was COMPLETELY unnecessary to release . It 's only about 3 mins longer which is made up from what I noticed of a couple partial nudity shots in the early middle of the film and a fleeting redundant mention of Conner 's mom in a speech he gives over a radio towards the end which I think was added in this version . Really not worth seeing at all . Adds nothing but a small additional length . It did make me laugh though - the conversation that may have lead to re-incorporating the topless bit for the director 's cut : Producer : `` Why are we re-adding this topless shot again ? `` Director : `` DUDE - the audience just is n't going to buy that she 'd want to save him later in the film unless we add this back in . When they see it , they 'll react like , 'Wait a second ! What 's going on ? Why is she saving him ? He has n't even seen her topless yet ! ! ! ' '' Producer : `` Uh huh . . . ``",m,0

I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off .

I wo n't add any spoilers here for those of you who do n't know how the movie ends . I liked the movie . . . until the end . What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me . Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that .,m,0

I did not really like Termin . Salvation too much . Maybe because it 's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring . There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me . For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3 . Peter J .

"It goes without saying that the `` best '' Terminator film was the first , simply because it *was* the first ! There is something to be said for originality , after all . Still I am far more impressed with `` Terminator Salvation '' for a couple of reasons : First , the theme of the other Terminator films is worn out . How many times can we watch a film about one terminator chasing some people all over the country before it gets old ? I always found the brief war scenes in those films far more intriguing , and I often wondered why the script writers did not include a lot more of them . At last , they have ! The whole film is about the war , and Skynet is no longer some distant , mostly unseen enemy but a true adversary who is visibly present in every scene . That is what I have wanted to see -- the WAR against the machines ! -- not a single terminator chasing people a few people around in circles again . Second , the special effects of this film were awesome . Whatever might be lacking in terms of acting skills which Terminator film had good acting anyway ? , it made up for it with special effects . The Terminators are so realistic that I have literally had a few nightmares about them -- just the kind of scare I love from a movie ! The only aspect that lacked realism is that the Terminators seem to be incompetent marksmen for being such advanced machines . How many rounds does it take to hit a target , after all ? `` Spray and Pray '' seems to be how Terminators shoot , which results in far more misses than hits , and that makes little sense to me when our contemporary computer-guided missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy . It also seems like an awful waste of ammunition to me . Nevertheless , I can see why it is a necessary part of the show . We could not have Terminators who shoot with pinpoint accuracy without blowing away all hope for human victory now , could we ? Ah , such unrealistic elements are a necessary evil . This is science *fiction , * after all ! All in all , this is my personal favorite of all the Terminator films . It may not have the originality of the first , but it is certainly the most impressive in terms of war scenes and special effects . This is why I am giving it a five-star rating .",m,1
"This review has spoilers and assumes most people reading it have seen the movie it 's been out for quite a while , so if that 's not you , you should probably skip this ! I approached this movie from the position that Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made . So its sequels have a lot to live up to . I did enjoy the third movie , but Terminator Salvation is relievedly grittier , with more action and lots of scary robots . It 's the year 2018 , and John Connor is 34 and a lieutenant in the Resistance ; his father , Kyle Reese , is a teenager somewhere in the wastelands of L . A . ; and a man named Marcus Wright appears , having last been seen receiving a lethal injection in 2003 . And yes . The external USB drive lives on . In the first half of the movie I was reminded so much of The Road Warrior or Mad Max 2 because that movie was so brilliantly , awfully dystopian , just the vast , unforgiving outback splattered with blood , populated by seriously , ridiculously insane people . Marcus Wright , Kyle Reese , and the silent child who looks very oddly like a young Janet Jackson are up against the same bleak landscape , only dealing with machines with a singular agenda . I was also reminded of Robocop , when Marcus realizes he did not die but was instead merged with cybernetics and metal ; and even Transformers , because of the height and bulk of some of the Skynet machines . The action sequences themselves are excellent , and you have to love the POV we 're presented with when Connor 's helicopter goes down near the beginning of the movie . The machines have always looked frightening , with their red eyes and body-builder necks , and I have to say they got my heart going in several scenes . There are fond homages , as is requisite with sequels , it seems : Marcus breaks out the windshield glass of a battered 18-wheeler ; Reese says `` Come with me if you want to live ; '' Arnold returns via CG . It was actually unnecessary to have the Marcus Wright character . The participants of the Resistance are up against enough as it is . His mission was n't to kill John , or Kyle . So what was it ? I ca n't even say , which means it must not have been that important . The movie did n't need a time-traveling machine man , and the more I think about it , the more the character could be taken out of the movie with little damage done to the plot . Obviously it 's not good for a main character to be so superfluous . Yes , I know , he gave his heart ; but as a writer I can tell you how easy it would be to just give John a different injury Interestingly , John Conner ends up fighting a machine that was twice his protector in the past a replica , of course . Though the terminator loses his `` Schwarzenegger face '' early , it is against him that both John and Marcus battle , and I found that kind of poetic and sad in a science-fictiony way . In the end , the terminator was always only a machine programmed with a mission . I have a problem with the forced romance between Marcus and Blair Williams , the young woman who fights in John 's unit . In fact , I have a problem with any movie that injects romance `` just because '' and it happens ALL the time and I 'm really tired of it . In this case , because Blair seems pretty plucky and self-sufficient , her feelings for Marcus , especially after finding out he 's a machine , make her seem just kind of weak and stupid . The movie should have tried to emphasize that Blair lives in a world with too few real prospects for love , a world in which `` not even if you were the last man on earth . . . `` has to be re-thought , and how depressing that is . But Blair seems content to be a soldier and just accept life for what it is . Not exactly the mindset of someone who would immediately fall in love with a robot . It just was n't well done , in my opinion , and there was a way it could have been and the writers director missed the mark . Another thing that disappointed me was that it is set in 2018 , not 2027 or whichever year people and machines began being sent back in time . I guess they want to start a new trilogy , but I think that 's too much . This movie should have been about the end of Skynet , plain and simple . Why call it `` Salvation '' otherwise ? I went in hoping to see John Conner truly save the world , not just move up the ranks . T2 was such a vast accomplishment , basically a perfect movie , that to try and keep the story alive will only continue to submit subsequent entries in the franchise to inevitable comparisons to a movie that can never be topped . Terminator Salvation is very good , better than the third , and I appreciated how well done the action was because it 's always so crucial to these movies . I think Christian Bale was a perfect choice for his role , and if you look at the John shown at the beginning of T2 , there is scarily some resemblance in certain light . However , the need for the Marcus Wright character just is n't there , and it 's depressing that the fight against Skynet STILL is n't over . At this point we can literally sympathize with the Resistance . . .",f,1
The story that are we were waiting for to continue one of the most interesting series of contemporary cinema,m,1
Better than Rise of the Machines but lacking any impact From lead actors . A movie by the numbers relying on CGI and explosions like Star Wars 1 2 & 3 .,m,1

"I thought this film was a step up from T3 's Terminatrix nonsense , but it still went downhill in the final 30 minutes as far as plot points go thus getting four stars . The entire film relies on the predictions of the nature of time travel . Several very bad military errors were made , even some by Connor himself , that made me want to choke those who wrote the script . This just takes away from any enjoyment of or engrossment in the action and possible emotions of the film . Cameron 's vision is ultimately lost where characters have not been developed to their full potential . As a woman , I see a failed role model in Blair Williams , who , far from what it appears they were going for , is more of a slut than a girl looking for comfort . I 'm sure the boobery helped to sell the movie , however . The corroborating plot points with T2 are extremely overt and annoying . They were not well-thought out , but thrown in to give a sense of continuity . The parts of Kyle Reese , Sam Worthington , and John Connor are played by excellent actors , and it is their performance that carries this movie along . If not for the bad writing , this film could have been absolutely amazing . For those excellent actors , I still retain that 4 star rating . Even so , the recordings Linda Hamilton made were obviously rushed and I do n't blame her . She was too good for this film . That said , this film should have been the real T3 . I consider it so in my collection . It deserves a place because the predicted War Against the Machines has come . It had to come , and it had to be told , to give any weight to the prophecies of the first two films . Or . . maybe the mystery was better . As for allegations to the Director 's cut not being worth it : it is nonsense to say that getting more film and features is worse than getting a theatrical version . Two minutes is two minutes , and I wanted to see it .",f,1
"I went into this flick expecting a big , fat flop . But what I got was a suspenseful , informative movie with a driving plot , exceptional acting , and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by . I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one . His presence was the kicker . Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye . These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in `` sequel '' doom and , therefore , expected to fail . With Christian being there , you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality , and they did not disappoint . There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around . Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated , it was awesome to see him again in a movie . Actually , it was a bit bittersweet . Because of the success of `` Terminator : Salvation , `` there has been ANOTHER sequel ordered . Let 's see if they can bring it , yet , once again . GREAT JOB TO ALL INVOLVED ! MY TERMINATOR HAT IS OFF TO YOU !",m,1
"TERMINATOR SALVATIONSTARRING : Christian Bale , Sam Worthington , Moon Bloodgood , Anton Yelchin , Helena Bonham Carter , Bryce Dallas Howard , Common , Jane Alexander , Michael Ironside and Chris BrowningWRITTEN BY : John D . Brancato and Michael FerrisDIRECTED BY : McGRated : PG-13Genre : Action Science FictionRelease Date : 21 May 2009It 's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on . As I am no exception , the Terminator series has always been my favorite . Unfortunately for me , I 'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation does n't exist . The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do ; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger , is like making Jaws without a shark . Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise that he started , I might add , two films ago ; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating ; and it seems absurdly pointless . Nevertheless , the film exists anyway . It 's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines . You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time , but you 'd be sadly mistaken . For whatever reason , yet again , a character that was visually perfected years ago 1984 , has now shown up computer generated . I ask the redundantly un-answered question again , with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY ? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage ? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda , nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980 ; so why should I even be surprised anymore ? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg 's classic , Jurassic Park . At first I was excited , but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI computer graphic imagery ? Let 's hope not . As if using CGI was n't bad enough ; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face ? Why are their heads so small ? If you have n't seen the film and do n't know what I 'm talking about , check out the cover of the single disc DVD . If the filmmakers are n't going to take their own movie seriously , how do they expect us to as audience members ? The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films . This time , Christian Bale gets a shot , and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet . Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have . And I 'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight ; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman ! What is the deal ? The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot . They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time , to save his mother Sara Connor , from a pesky Terminator . If you go with it , it 's a lot of fun . If you stop and dwell on it though , it will give you a splitting headache . For the sake of this review , we 'll just go with it . In this one , we are in the future nearly the entire time ; with the exception of the first few minutes , where we start back in 2003 . We meet a new character named Marcus Wright Sam Worthington . Marcus is on death-row . For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film , he volunteers the use of his body to research , for Cyberdynde Systems the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators , thus causing Judgment Day . From there , we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive , and the self aware nightmare Skynet . John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet 's hidden secret : a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators . Schwarzenegger 's brand , in case you were wondering . Connor delivers the message to his chain of command . They plan on taking Skynet out , based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines , with some sort of signal . Where did this signal come from ? Who knows ? Why did n't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama ? Because this is the third sequel and let 's face it , they 're reaching . Folks , that 's the best explanation I have for you . Something I could not figure out for the life of me , no matter how many times I re-round the DVD ; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock . He falls from a bridge that has been blown up which looked awesome , by the way , and then sure enough , goes skipping down the river , bouncing like a ragdoll . Aside from bad directing and editing , what could have possibly caused this to happen ? Also , in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water , everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave . So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily , `` What are you ? `` Was this accidently placed in the film out of order ? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy , perhaps ? Whether you 're a fan of the series or not , Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you . By now , you surely know him from Avatar ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron . He is a true gift to action-movie fans : a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero , while being able to act extraordinarily well . You wo n't find too many of those . Had it not tried to be a Terminator film , it may have been a little better . The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking . We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI . But this only made me question again , why the Terminators looked so horrible . Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act . If you 've seen the first two films , then you 've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation . Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here ; only in reverse order . And do you recall in The Terminator , when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines , and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator ; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go ? Yeah , well if you do n't , it 's all here again for you ; nearly frame for frame . This may be considered a SPOILER , to some , but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy ; to point out that they also CGI 'd Arnold 's face onto the body of another actor , for a cameo . I guess these filmmakers did n't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger ; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button . They did n't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films , either . All they had to do was take off six years ; he looked great in Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines . Guys , come on . If I had to guess , they probably did this because they were n't able to get Arnold on-board , with their poor excuse for a script . And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was ; as he did for the third film . But if that 's the case , then you do n't use a shot of Arnold at all , hello ! You come up with something else , original . Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap ? Crap may very well be cheaper , but it 's not as appealing to the eye .",m,0
"I was never a big fan of the Termintor franchise after the first film . I thought T2 had great special effects and a knockout performance by Linda Hamilton and T3 was an amusing send-up but they both lacked the freshness of the original . Thankfully Terminator Salvation takes the series in a completely different direction while still keeping in theme with the first movie . What really makes T4 a thrill for me is that the actors make the most of their somewhat typical screenplay . Christian Bale is good as usual but Sam Worthington , Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin rise above their flatter dialogue and give us characters you want to root for . The special effects in this film are also great , but unfortunatly loose alot of their impact on DVD . The transfer tears a bit and like most things on the small screen it 's easier to pickout where the green-screen begins and the real actors end some of the cooler stunts look laughable on DVD . So like I said , if you liked the movie Terminator Salvation is still a must buy . It you are bothered by an unperfect copy then best to test out the Blu-Ray .",m,1

"**Contains minor spoilers** First off , this is not Arnold 's Terminator . If you 're expecting the same thing as the first three , you 'll be disappointed by this movie . Nor is it a serious philosophical work . It is simply a continuation of the first three , from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light . The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright , two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined . Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet 's prisoner-holding facilities ; in the process , many die . Connor makes it out alive , but so does someone else . . . Wright , who was being held in the facility , emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated . Thus begins a long , twisted path on which both men embark . Along the way , they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other 's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright 's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light . Meanwhile , they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese , in order to manipulate history in their own favor ; at the same time , Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself , offering up a sort of `` Trojan Horse '' in order to take out high command . There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to `` Salvation '' -- personal , and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey . In the end , one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life . Now , aside from my brief retelling trying not to give away too much , my opinion . It 's very well done , and highly enjoyable , to me at least . Obviously , there are many who disagree . But I enjoyed the twists and turns , and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater . Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it ? Yes , if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it . I , however , think it is one of the best , if not the best , in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho . Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters , and I 'm not ; and , frankly , I do n't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one . I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 which I was n't terribly fond of came out . Also , this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything ; for a `` light '' movie which it certainly is , it tends to jump about , and make sudden detours . Not unpleasantly , to me at least , but there it is . My advice ? See it with an open mind , and do n't expect a masterpiece . If you do , you might like it ; I personally thought it was awesome .",f,1

"`` Terminator Salvation '' is the beginning of a new saga in the `` Terminator '' franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron 's hit `` The Terminator '' . Directed by McG , this takes place fifteen years after the events of `` Terminator : Rise of the Machines '' , which ended with the onslaught of `` Judgment Day '' , the day when all the world 's machines rose up against humanity . John Connor , this time played by Christian Bale , is now settled into his prophetized role as Resistance Leader Only Hope for Humanity against the terminator machines . Yet Connor struggles with his mission as the great emancipator warrior and Bale shows this internal strife very well . As we get to know Connor and his ragtag group of rebels , we see the two people entering his life who play major roles in his fight : Marcus , played by Sam Worthington , a death row inmate from several years ago who took part in a scientific procedure which ended up converting him into a human cyborg hybrid and Kyle Reese , well portrayed by Anton Yelchin . Reese , of course , one day becomes the father of John in the earlier Terminator mythos , yet John is tasked with finding him and keeping him alive in this alternate time frame . Though not always as lively , fast paced as the earlier Schwarzenegger films , T-S has a few well produced set pieces for example : the road bridge chase involving Marcus , Reese and a couple of terminator motorcycles ; the capture of rebels by a 20 ft harvester terminator ; and Connor 's battle with a Schwarzenegger cyborg lookalike . The aftermath of Judgment Day has led to his new chapter in Connor 's life and his fulfillment as a savior of humanity and it somehow still works without the presence of Schwarzenegger , simply because it takes the story in a different direction and adds new layers to the original mythology . The Film looks great on Blu-ray : Strong visuals and a clear soundtrack do enough to enhance McG 's vision . A very good addition to one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made .",m,1
"3 stars because I like the movie , but the Director 's Cut is as the others have stated . Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer . Personally I think they could 've kept it at a PG-13 rating . . .",m,0
"Spoilers ! I was having a pretty good time with this movie . The special effects were solid , the storyline fairly cohesive and Sam Worthington 's performance was strong . I fully expected Marcus to not survive the movie , but when they arrived back at the rebel camp I had was pleasantly surprised he survived the fight at Skynet . Then the massive , huge let down with him volunteering his heart to save John Connor . The really irritating part is John nodding to him like `` Good show old chap , I 'll make good use of it '' . Marcus had every bit as much right to `` life '' as it were and was the most compelling character in the film much more so than Connor Bale . He would have made an excellent torch bearer to carry on the fight and could have breathed new life into the series . As it is we get a stupid ending with Bale set for another sequel . For those saying it would ruin any congruity between Salvation and previous films , Connor already stated his mother 's recordings make no mention of such a `` terminator '' - it could be explained as the time line unexpectedly shifting just as it would have if Kyle had been killed . John Connor should have died , Marcus should have lived . The last minute re-write from what I heard spoiled this film for me .",m,0

How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director 's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series ? Maybe he did n't teeny-bop Salvation , but it was very weeknight CW networked up . Bottom line : Terminator Salvation is a rental",m,0
"Visually and action wise , okay . This is an obligatory part of the series - the problem is that it showed in the directing and script . I think one key part of the plot revealed itself a little soon and tensions could have run a lot higher throughout . The original is still the best . This kind of movie really demands to be taken seriously , although that is probably a little difficult after they botched the sequel to the first installment with that goofy stoned kid , lazy directing , and half baked cheesy lines . It 's a shame since the story is a postulation of things soon to come . If you scoffed at that last comment , look up the word postulate . It really should have been treated with more reverence . Getting around in this wreckage of a fantasy world is too easy . They could have shown off more of the Jeep 's capabilities and the effort needed to make it through some areas . It lacked a journey and was more just snapshots of events . Still decent though if you 've at least seen the first one .",m,1
"From the very first bars of the Coriolan Overture , it is apparent that this is Beethoven at his very best . Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair . There is plenty to discover : sounds and textures never heard before , an orchestral timbre as the composer himself may have envisaged and heard , incredible strength and cohesion and , on the other hand , sensitive nuances that often disappear under a blanket of massed strings in more traditional interpretations . Listen to the period woodwinds , the valveless trumpets and horns , the timpani actually striking the music 's beat ! Enough . As the interpretations go , all three are glorious and fully in tune with the respective works . In the symphonies , Jurowski lovingly takes his time with the first two movements to press on rather relentlessly in the final movements . Believe me : it works . Sound and video of the 2010 recording are great and the Paris audience in the beautiful Th & eacute ; atre des Champs-Elys & eacute ; es is rightly bowled over . Do not miss this disk .",m,1
"There are of course numerous authoritative readings of the pieces recorded in this DVD . The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment , however , is a period instrumental ensemble . There are some people who adamantly refuses to accept any 'period ' performance of Beethoven 's grand symphonies . I approachded this disc with reservation myself , but the performance as recorded quickly dispelled any of my remaining concern . The recorded sound is very good . I first played the disc without viewing , and was rapturous of the accoustics , and much more so as I listened further by the performance . Jurowski has a good credential as an opera conductor . He is in charge currently of the Glyndebourne Festival , and has conducted at Italy , Germany , USA , and at large opera houses , even the MET , all to critical acclaim . Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this musician 's strength lies not only in opera . The wonderful pianist Sviastoslav Richter began his pianistic career doing piano rehearsals for opera houses . Nobody termed the legendary Richter an 'opera pianist ' . What is in the operas , often goes into a composer 's instrumental music , W A Mozart is a clear example to boot . The conducting of Jurowski is clearly dramatic , but at the same time totally idiomatic . You will not find a Beethoven that is like Wagner . Having watched him live , Vladimir is clearly one of those 'conducting before the music ' conductors . For young conducting talents , the No . 7 Symphony here reminds me of Guido Cantelli 's own stereo recording of this masterpiece , a performance that is totally youthful and energised . Jurowski and the OAE comes really close to that legendary reading .",m,1
"Where to begin ? My friend Gerhard Knapp loves this disc see his review . Usually we see eye to eye . In this case , I 'm afraid we 'll have to agree to disagree ! I 've listened to it several times , but I ca n't warm to it . Let me say that my own preference for Beethoven is big-band sumptuous sound . I like the Thielemann Vienna Phil . set . I 'm not fond of the scratchy , honky sounds that emanate from these `` original instruments '' . Sir Thomas Beecham once famously pronounced that they sounded like cats copulating on a tin roof . I would n't go that far , but I do think you have to play the music swiftly if you 're going to minimize the unprettiness of these old instruments . Jurowski plays these symphonies way too slowly , especially the fast movements , so you get a lot of unusual , and for me , unwelcome noises coming through . It is often said that this is how Beethoven heard his music . First of all , his deafness prevented him hearing much of anything , but I 'm convinced that had he been able to appreciate today 's much improved instruments and more skillful players , he would have much preferred this later sound . If you like your Beethoven small , quick and lean , try to hear the Paavo Jarvi set with his Bremen orchestra on Sony DVD . His attack and phrasing are something to behold . Sadly not available from Amazon in the U . S . A , you can get it from `` import cds '' in California , amongst other sources . These are as exciting as any you 'll ever hear , and contain the `` wickedest '' Beethoven # 7 I 've ever heard ! Even a large orchestra guy like me can love this set ! So this Jurowski for me was disappointing , but others may like it better . My advice is get the Jarvi set . It really is remarkable .",m,0
I WAS EXPECTING A DETAIL STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION BUT INSTEAD I GOT THE DIRECTOR OF THIS VIDEO TALKING AND TALKING IN THE SCREEN FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE VIDEO,f,0
"Nice Documentary video . Great for it 's time but lacking by today 's standards . Many scenes are reversed in the movie . Major flaw from the editors . Easily seen as the charging handles for rifles and sub guns are on the wrong side . It was a simpler time , did anyone notice back then ?",m,0
"I think this is the most underrated movie I know of . And I frankly do n't understand why it 's not a major hit readily available on DVD . It 's very well directed and cast -- I especially like Giancarlo Giannini sp ? , but Conti and Olmos and others were great too . However , the real power of the movie derives from the quality of Celia Gittelson 's story . It 's intelligent , warm-hearted , deep , and very funny . I watch it on sad evenings before I fall off to sleep , and life 's not so bad . I ca n't help using this as a forum to explain what I see in the movie . The Pope grows heavy from being an abstraction -- longs to return to the life of a priest where he can do some concrete good for concrete people . And suddenly he finds himself with an opportunity to wander in the world incognito . This of course leaves room for all kinds of hysterical lines by people who do n't know who he is `` You can go straight to hell . Who do you think you are ? `` or `` Maybe he 's a priest ? `` `` Naw , a priest would tell us we go to hell for this . `` , and how his friends at the Vatican try to cover for him `` You got a job ? . . . With all due respect , your Holiness , ca n't these villagers sort their own rags ? `` And there 's one concrete thing that he wants to do . He -- the most significant -- is guided to it , by one of the most insignificant a deaf girl from a small village Isabella who has taken the step of leaving her home to find him . . . and this act somehow demands that he respond . It 's the story of how the Christ figure who I regard as our own true self comes to earth and lives among us ; how he works ; what doubts , fears and confusions he has ; what matters to him ; what effect he has on various types of people . It 's an explanation of the mechanism whereby mankind is redeemed . The mechanism is to go to a place where people are defeated , take on some arbitrary project which represents a positive step , and simply act . The extent to which you know what you 're doing is irrelevant . What matters is the intention . The Pope chooses in this defeated village to rebuild the aqueduct . He knows nothing about construction . And as none of the important people -- the adult males -- will help , he gets his help from those whom society deems insignificant -- orphaned children , widows . And then you see the incredibly venomous and destructive reaction which his actions evoke in the negative forces in the society . They begin by burning the partially reconstructed aqueduct . At this point Isabella 's beautiful , sane and soulful mother -- with whom he is falling in love -- asks him , `` So what are you going to do ? `` `` I 'll build it again . `` `` He 'll just burn it again . `` `` So I 'll build it again . And when he comes back , I 'll be here . I 'll be waiting for him . `` It maybe sounds stupid , but on several occasions in life , I 've felt defeated -- my actions seem to be in a void , no one notices -- and this movie somehow helps me to get off my duff and 'rebuild the aqueduct ' . . . restore my faith that my intention is heard somewhere in the ether , even if I ca n't see the results . I find myself these days also relating the film to world politics . It 's an essentially European film , and it restores my faith somehow that despite all their criticism of the US these days , Europe does understand the mechanism of nihilism and restoration . Europe too is on some level understandably defeated . And for all her doubts and failings , I believe the US is a positive force in the world . . . The second attempt to burn is headed off by his band of ophaned boys whose allegiance the Pope has usurped from the main bad guy Olmos . In the third burning , the incredibly charming leader of the gang is killed . He 's the sacrificial lamb which spreads the Pope 's intentions among the community as a whole . The Pope now feels defeated , but the community fills in . And then there 's the one town drunk , Abalardi , who lives on the outskirts , tends sheep , and is the only one who recognizes the Pope for who he really is . `` Please excuse the sheep . They see so few Popes . . . They fired you or what ? `` `` No , I had n't thought of that . No , they did n't fire me . Maybe God did . . . `` `` I can put your mind to rest on that . . . there 's no such person . `` Abalardi has the best role , and it 's acted perfectly . At last the Pope asks , `` Who are you , Abelardi ? `` I can keep a secret .",f,1
"The premise of this movie is what captivated me . The Pope on the loose . How would or could he cope ? There are too many flaws to rate this too highly most would think I already have , but I never tire of seeing this movie , especially with someone who has n't seen it . Have n't shown it to anyone who did n't like it . Give it a view . And by the way , I 'm not the only one who 'd buy the DVD immediately .",m,1
This is a movie that lifts me up when I 'm down . I too wish it was on DVD . I read through a few of the five star ratings and really liked what they had to say . I wish more people in the world were like this . I know of few people who are very good to other people and have charitable dispositions . I like to watch this movie and try to live the example that was set . Please get it made into a DVD .,f,1
"I saw this movie first in 1995 and thoroughly enjoyed it . I love the story , the characters , the fine acting . It is a truly a beautiful movie . A gem .",f,1
"I was very thankful to find this movie . It 's one of my favorites . Catholic or not , you 'll enjoy this touching movie .",f,1
"I had seen this movie many years ago and lost track of who had it in my family . I decided I needed to see it again . It was worth more than I paid . Rare to see a non-religious `` religious '' film . With warmth and humor the story of Pope Leo and the defeated village of Monte Petra reaffirms the value of elegance in story telling and the power of great and honest acting to move the soul . The humanity rooted in love , even when love can be a hard pill to swallow , can and in this case does , inspire . Tom Conti 's character in very human , striving to cope with almost superhuman responsibilities . His `` escape '' to find his people allows him to find himself again . . . and his spiritual Guide . Enjoy this one with your family !",m,1
"I am soooo excited that this movie is FINALLY available on DVD ! If I could own only 3 or 4 movies - this would definitely be one of them . Heartwarming , subtle humor and a great story . Catholic , non Catholic - it does n't matter - you 'll love the story . Do n't Miss it !",m,1
"A long lost gem , this is such a wonderful movie ! Tom Conti is perfect as the Pope who 's accidentally locked out of the Vatican and finds a purpose in helping a small town escape from the evil seduction of dependency on government handouts .",f,1
I bought this for a friend because it is one of my favorite movies ever !,f,1
"All this time , I thought I was the only who loved this movie as much as you do . I had a copy of this movie at one time and was so eager for my friends to see it , I loaned it to a preacher when he had surgery and I never saw the movie again and he joined the Navy and moved to Spain . Ever since , I have been looking for this movie on DVD . What a disappointment that it is n't on DVD . Whenever I think of the movie , I ca n't help but smile . It has such true meaning for humanitarian causes . Please keep me posted when it comes out on DVD if ever . I am so glad there is a Saving Grace following !",f,1
"I rented this movie a couple of time a few years back . It is funny and a real faith builder too . It is a shame that the film is out of print and was never put on a DVD . In the meantime , I can still enjoy it on my trusty VHS player . I strongly recommend that you scoop up one of the last copies of the movie still available",m,1
"I read the review where someone said this movie is full frame , so I referenced this movie on dvdplanet . com . Sure enough , it says it 's full frame ! ! Unforgiveable ! ! I think this is 1 of the best movies ever . Who is the bird brained gremmie responsible for sabotaging this dvd ? Grrrrrrr . I was going to buy this dvd , but now I will just record from my ES II laserdisc onto a dvd .",m,0
"It is hard to improve on the original , but this DVD comes real close . Any surf film can show good waves , but what separates ES II is Bruce Brown 's narrative reminiscent of ES , the characters , and how this movie flows . There is enough non-surf events going off that it stays fresh from start to finish . Add this one to the collection , and hope that the formats do n't change too soon .",m,1
Endless Summer II joins its predecessor in the `` Classic Surf '' movie genre . It 's not quite as good as the original or I 'd have given it 5 stars .,m,1
The video show some of the best surfers and breaks ever . The footage is great . Some of the best surf in the world .,m,1
"Communion is a terrifically atmospheric sci-fi that scared the wits out of me . I found the scene in the woods with the lights to be all too familiar . I heard that Walken was and is a total non-believer . He 's sure a great actor . When he was scared trick or treating I jumped out of my skin . Needless to say , I highly recommended this alien abduction movie that 's based on the alleged true recollections of Whitley Strieber . Watch it and see if it rings any bells .",m,1
The product quality is fine . I purchased this move to compare with `` The Fourth Kind '' . Very Interesting similarities .,m,0
". . . watching Walken & Crouse is worth the price of the disc alonehonorable mention to the kid and the 'lil blu guys '' . . . . you know how these things go . . . but all I can say is that Im glad this is not my bedroom . . . . so anyway , try to have a good night . . . . OK ? `` Interestingly I have a 2004 105 min version PAL from Germany [ Die Besucher ] -is cut differentlyand because of PAL 5 % speedup that would mean the film would be about 110 min in NTSC land",m,1
"After watching , you ask yourself , did this really happen ? Frightening . Christopher Walken is always worth watching .",m,0
The movie closely follows the book some say its a hoax a lie or imagination . I say lets find out great story 80 's dated style but an overall bizarre account,f,1
"Communion Special Collector 's Edition 1989 was a three star production in this reviewers opinion . Both Christopher Walken and Lindsay Crouse were excellent , but little else is noteworthy . I will say that the film had several near moments , but always came up short of what could have been done .",m,0
"As most film adaptations of great novels go , this could have been better . There were a few pieces missing that I felt were very important in the book . This movie was more about the effect on the family and just what happened to Whitely . I will say though that Christopher Walken was a great choice . His reactions to the `` visitors '' are just classic .",m,1
"Is Strieber insane . Or is he making this crazy account up to sell books and inspire films ? I 'll have to say yes to the latter . However , do n't let that dissuade you from a creepy film like Communion . Although , the plot is VERY disjointed there are very distubing scenes . Have you ever felt like an alien creature was creeping into your bedroom as you slept ? Well , you will after seeing a scene that depicts exactly that . Memorably disturbing scenes of this nature give this otherwise uninteresting film a decent shelf life .",m,0
"This was a great movie ; and introduced the dynamic acting of Christopher Walken to me . It also scared the you-know-what out of me . I must have seen this movie a dozen times and still get scared each time . If you 've ever had even a remotely similar experience as what is depicted in this movie , you 'll be leaving the lights on at bedtime guaranteed .",m,1
"Where do I begin here ? Molly Ringwald plays an urchin of a girl on a planet that is run by an overlord using young women as sex objects even though he himself is part machine . Sound strange ? Well , it is . Oddly enough , the film is very watchable too largely due to the actors . Peter Strauss is very handsome here and has a slight Han Solo act going . He meets up with Molly Ringwald and their relationship is hard to decipher at times . It seems they always end up sleeping together in silver quilted sleeping bags , her arm draped across him even though he could be her father . Is their relationship romantic or platonic ? Hard to tell here . The special effects are very well done and the scenery beautiful ! There is just enough action and just high enough production and just strange enough situations to keep one interested even though there is n't anything too , too deep here . People searching for a new Star Wars will be disapointed but those who want something sort of offbeat in space will probably like this .",m,1
"Originally released as an 80 's `` 3-D film '' which is why theopening title is so hard to read on conventional TV withall the whizzy meteors flying out , Spacehunter is nonethelessa well made film that does `` take you out of your living room '' . For me , the vehicle designs and the rocky Utah scenary are thebest aspects of the film . The production design is brilliantand the acting convincing . The buggies are fantastic ! Well worth buying but perhaps more for diehard sci-fi fans . Thefilm is not really suitable for younger viewers even though itsmarketed at a `` Star Wars '' audience and has much of that film'scharacter and hardware style . Michael Ironside plays a great villian , a pity we do n't get alittle more of his charcater 's background and how he evolvedinto a villian .",m,1
The movie has a good story line . The actors do a great job . Special effect for 1983 are good . I saw this when it came out in theaters . This was the first movie I watched with Molly Ringwald and became an instant fan . I am glad I added it to my collection .,m,1
"Picture a Tough-hard as nails space captain who owes more money than there is in Fort Knox . . . Pay every one off , easy-just rescue three hot women from a forbidden world . Who can he call on for help , a money hungry space-cop , a hot robot bombshell , a junker space ship that 's just spare parts flying in formation , and a young survivor girl . If you enjoy fighting mutants , rescuing damsels in distress and good one liners , here 's your movie .",m,1
Kind of like `` Mad Max '' in space . A sci-fi B movie but I find it entertaining . But then I like Sci Fi B movies,m,0
"ok , so this is n't the best sci-fi movie ever but it really is fun , if you can get into it . this adventure looks like a cross between `` road warrior '' and `` alien '' as it tells the story of a bounty hunter wolfe peter strauss , tring hard but just not han solo landing on a planet ravaged by plage to rescue three ladies who crashed there and are being held hostage by the strangest villian ever overdog michael ironside looking like a borg and being a grade a ham ! young molly ringwald is on hand as is ernie hudson to help strauss get the girls back . slow in places and some really strange encounters with the planets other citizens make it a mixed bag , but as i said if you can get into the spirit of fun you may find that you like this one also ! give it a try !",m,1
"This is one of my favorite movies . I watched this way back , and I later bought the tape when the price was $ 25 and considered it a great value . I still watch that movie once in a while . It 's high adventure and an all together great movie .",m,1
"Three years after `` Facts of Life , `` but a year away from her triumphant role in `` Sixteen Candles , `` Molly Ringwald finds herself the prisoner of some tricked-out bum named Overdog on a junk planet that looks like Fred Sanford 's backyard . Peter Strauss , the poor man 's Richard Chamberlain , plays the poor man 's Han Solo or Lone Starr , if you prefer and tries to rescue her . Yes , `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' is low-budget fun directed by Lamont Johnson . According to the IMDb , Johnson once played Tarzan on radio . With this movie , he shows a keen radio performer 's eye for cinema . Ripping off `` Star Wars '' and `` Road Warrior '' and featuring more rickety metal garbage than any four episodes of TLC 's `` Junkyard Wars , `` this flick has a spunky little heart but little else to offer . Ringwald would go on to become John Hughes ' teen muse and the undisputed 80s teen comedy queen , usually playing upper middle class girls dating sexless , nonthreatening gimps like Andrew McCarthy . Here , she 's a punky little spitfire who needs a bath and a shave . Come to think of it , she IS the spunky little heart of this movie . The rest of it can go to hell ! But I kid `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone . `` It 's a silly movie with a clumsy title , yet worth watching with friends some drunken evening . But please- try not to confuse `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' with `` Metalstorm : the Destruction of Jared Synn . `` They both have colons in their titles , and promise things like `` adventures , `` `` destruction '' and `` Jared Synn . `` But only `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' has Molly Ringwald being tortured by Michael Ironside . Ask for it by name !",m,0
"This movie has a serious pacing problem . It runs very slow in most of the non-action parts , but runs quickly in the action sequences . The dialog is terrible . Give nervous actors non-natural dialog and the whole movie looks more like a bad high school production . Molly Ringwald character tends to ramble on and on . Midway through , the movie forgets it is in 3D . One sequence in particular , walking across the desert , goes on and on . I watched Spacehunter in 1983 in the theater . It was my first 3D movie . I thought it was a good b-movie at the time . Viewing the same movie now shows me it had lots of ideas but not much money . Somehow , the non action sequences go slowly and the characters are just doing exposition instead of reacting to what happens .",m,0
"The picture quality is photographic and now I can hear the birds chirping at the start of Commando . . . bliss ! Having to rent these classic movies in VHS format has hindered my full appreciation of their outstanding quality . For those like myself who are too young to have seen them on the big screen , watching Commando is a new and delightful experience . Although I am not a huge fan of violent movies , I can assure you that Commando is one of the best 'comedies ' of all time with almost enough memorable quotes to rival Fawlty Towers ! Running Man is my favorite of this collection only surpassed by True Lies as my favorite Arnie . And with the inclusion of Predator and Total Recall , none of the titles are 'fillers ' unlike other collections , these are all blockbusters . You 'll love Commando for the commedy , Running Man for the action , Total Recall for the sci-fi , and Predator for the adrenaline rush . Other great features include : Dolby Pro-Logic sound for all Total Recall has Dolby Digital and both widescreen and normal versions of Total Recall . I had high expectations . I was not dissappointed .",m,1
"action , Action , ACTION , and . . . Yes , thats right , more hard-hitting action . Arnie really knows what his audience wants . I will now review each film individually . TOTAL RECALL . With perfect doses of Action , Sci-fi and Special Effects , this film is a near perfect Action Sci-fi . Arnie acting is at its best and the supporting cast including Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox are all very believable . 5 STARS . PREDATOR . Another Perfect Action Sci-fi what would you expect from the director of Die Hard < p > Everything in it the Music , the cast , the sets all combine to give the film a certain feel like in the alien films The sction and violence comes hard and fast and the special effects by the Brilliant Stan Winston are State-of-the-art . 5 STARS . THE RUNNING MAN . A chilling view of the world to come . Arnold is back as he promised to be and in one of his most violent and exciting movies . The bad guys are also some of the toughest Arnie has faced , Sub-zero and Buzz-saw to name two and the sets are frighteningly realistic . Might be a bit rough for some . as with all of these movies 5 STARS . COMMANDO . If Rambo had a Daughter , he would be Commando . This has to have one of the highest body counts of any American Movies . Non-stop Action and Laughs . the laughs come from the classic lines Arnie gives , EG .

"While this is not your typical romance , it is in fact the differences that make this a true masterpiece . The movie starts with Roberts having a meal with her good friend and editor George . George happens to be gay . It is interesting that George is not ashamed of being gay , but he does n't scream it from the rooftops either . He is to be the voice of reason in this comedy of mishaps . Roberts is happy to get a call from her former romantic partner Michael . But this soon turns to panic when she realizes that he is marrying Kimmy . Roberts is getting an invitation to the wedding . George tries to calm roberts down , but to no avail . She is determined to break the wedding . Whether we are routing for Roberts or find her actions cruel , somehow we get the impression that she is fighting a doomed uphill battle . We meet Kimmy , and we have no reason to doubt that they are a proper match . To be sure , there is one weak point that Roberts finds and exploits , but let 's be fair . What relationship does n't have some weak point ? Roberts realizes that her plans have backfired , and she desperately calls George for help . George tries to be a friend to Roberts , but his patience wears down when he sees her new plan . Pretending she is engaged to George to make Michael jealous . While George plays along , it is clear that he has had it with this whole thing . He nails the crux of the matter when he says : `` Do you really love him , or this just about winning ? `` Roberts then starts to lie about George . Her determination to win this lost cause has caused her to lie about the one man who really cares about her . It is interesting that when we see Michael and Roberts together , we can infer their relationship had serious flaws . There is usually if not always a visible tension . In a final desperate attempt to stop the wedding , Roberts does something that is not only deceptive and cruel , but flat out illegal . Fraud to say the least . Only then does her conscience start to wake up . But even though she is learning that there is more to life than our own passions and desires , she still fights to win this man who does n't love her . This is underlined in a comical , but tragic car chase . Only after Roberts realizes her cruelty as well as her absurd actions does she realize that if someone does n't love you , you ca n't make them . This movie is a masterpiece complete with a great story , superb acting , and a harmonious mixture of comedy and tragedy . But even more than that , it underlines that TRIUMPH comes NOT always from getting what we want , but reaching the point where we can see beyond our passions and desires to do what is right . While there is a certain sadness in the restoration of order , we also know it is right . But joy reenters when George proves himself to be a real friend , and is there for her .",m,1
"My Best Friend 's Wedding is probably Julia Roberts best romantic comedy , even better than Pretty Woman . Dermont Mulroney , Cameron Diaz , and Rupert Everett also star in this tale of a food critic played by Roberts who is invited to intend her best friend 's upcoming nupitals , but the thing is she is in love with her best friend and tries everything in her power to break up the wedding . I wo n't give away the ending but this is actually a good and solid romantic comedy and I think everyone who decides to watch will throughly enjoy it . Good luck !",f,1
I enjoyed this deliteful romantic comedy . I am not much of a Julia Roberts fan But I enjoyed her in this movie .,f,1
I was very glad this movie did n't end up being a silly romance and break the couple up just to rekindle an old relationship ! A good watch for a dull Saturday afternoon .,f,0

THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC . . . . IT HAS LINES THAT HAVE YOU REPEATING OVER AND OVER AGAIN . . . . MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE WATCHING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER . . . ITS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE .,f,1
"First off , Julia Roberts to me is an actress who has become more beautiful with age even to this day . Having said that , I was anxious to see this movie because of her and Cameron Diaz . I have seen My Best Friend 's Wedding three times and I must admit that I have viewed it differently each time I 've seen it . What I mean by this is that I have never really been able to decide which woman the groom should end up with ; his bride-to-be or his best friend . Granted , Julia does every rotten thing she can in this film to break up her best friend 's wedding so from that viewpoint I favored him ending up with Cameron . On the other hand as one reviewer put it , Julia and her best friend had more chemistry than the groom and his bride-to-be so from that viewpoint I also favored him ending up with Julia . During the film , there are times when I rooted for Julia to get her man despite her despicable efforts to win him over yet other times I wanted Cameron to end up with the groom . This movie still entertains me even after knowing the outcome . Aside from the simple plot of breaking up the wedding , this film has good humor , good acting , a decent soundtrack , and is overall a believable chick flick for the most part . Even guys like myself should find it to be entertaining as I am normally picky when it comes to chick flicks . The special edition dvd is worth picking up if you have n't seen the features . One of the featurettes shows the original alternative ending which is much different from how the film originally ended . Which of the two endings are better ? Only the viewer can decide . As for me , I 'm not telling . Anyway , the bonus features are overall good and plentiful . The only problem is that the camera focus on one of the featurettes is somewhat off and distorts the picture a bit . Nothing too serious but very noticable . I suppose a sequel to this movie would have been interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out ?",m,1
"I do n't understand all the fuss about Julia Roberts , she does n't play very well and she is n't even good looking ! Cameron Diaz instead is magnificiant in her role , she 's totaly convincing and really beautiful . This movie deserves 5 stars mainly because she 's in it . The story is quite good , it 's funny at times . If you want some entertainement or you want to see Cameron Diaz , buy this movie .",m,1
"MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDDING is a hilarious romantic-comedy . Julia Roberts is truly at her best in this film as Julianne , a food critic who 's long-time childhood best friend , Michael Dermot Mulroney is getting married to some other woman , just when Julianne starts to have feelings for him ! The woman Michael is marrying is Kimberly Cameron Diaz , a college student with a fillthy-rich father . Julianne is hopelessly in love with Michael , so to get Michael back , Julianne must find a way to stop the wedding and make Michael fall in love with Julianne herself ! She gets her partner and friend , George Rupert Everett , to help her win over Michael . The ending is actually surprising , because you 'd think Julianne wins back Michael , but she actually does n't . So it is good to see the protagonist in a film to not get what they want in the end , but can still have a happy ending . The whole cast is absolutely superb ! And one of my favorite scenes is when Julianne and George pretend that they just got engaged George is really gay , and while meeting Kimberly 's family for dinner and they ask how George proposed to Julianne , George starts singing the song `` I Say A Little Prayer '' , and then everyone else in the cast starts joining in , except for Julianne and Michael . It 's a very funny movie with a witty script . If you have not yet seen MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING , then what are you waiting for ? But definitely get the special edition DVD for this movie because it 's better than the other DVD . I just love MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING ! Great date movie , too . A must see .",f,1
"Dont get me wrong . This isnt a bad film . its not a excellent one either . Julia roberts came across as pathetic , and a little unlikeable , as she tried to steal her best friend from his marriage to kimmy cameron diaz . there are quite a few good scenes in this film . The restaraunt scene is very enjoyable , where the whole table erupts with singing . it is a very bitty film in my opinion , all over the place . dont expect a typical romance , because you will be sorely dissapointed .",f,0
"This is one of my favorite movies . I 've watched it over and over again 'coz I was captivated by the story and cast . I really loved this flick , it 's really hilarious , and cute ! Julia looks great in the movie , and she truly did a good job . This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and gets you thinking what you really want , and who you are . Go watch it !",f,1
This is my daughter 's all-time favorite movie and has been on her wish list since she started it . I was happy to FINALLY get a copy for her . It arrived in excellent condition and very promptly . The seller was great and my daughter has already selected her charmingly handsome gay escort should her `` best '' friend-boy marry .,f,1
"IT 'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE . . . . SHOWS US THE FOIBLES OF LIFE AND HOW EVERYTHING GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHEN MR . RIGHT COMES ALONG . JULIA ROBERTS IS PERFECT IN THIS ROLE AND DERMOT MULRONEY CAN HOLD HIS OWN ON SCREEN WITH HER . LOVE CAMERON DIAZ AS THE 'OTHER WOMAN ' . PATS ON THE BACK FOR THE CAST SELECTIONS HERE , NOBODY PLAYS A BAD PART . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I HAVE VIEWED IT MANY TIMES AND I WILL WATCH IT MANY MORE TIMES IN THE FUTURE .",f,1
"Sharp-witted and genuinely engaging , `My Best Friend 's Wedding ' is a surefire hit for anyone interested in a crowd pleasing romantic comedy . It has a few missteps , that 's a give in , but the charming performances and blissful ending not one you might expect make up for the few errors in judgment . The film tells the story of Julianne Potter , a successful woman approaching thirty who is afraid of falling in love . Truth be told , she is in love , with Michael O'Neal , her best friend of over nine years . The two had once been together but quickly fell apart only to realize that they were too close to be lovers . When Michael calls to inform Julianne he is engaged she is suddenly thrown into panic mode as she realizes that she needs to be with Michael . She flies off for the wedding with one plan in mind ; to break up the happy couple . She never expected Kim , Michael 's fianc & eacute ; e , to be as sweet and perfect as she was , but her perfection was only more fuel to the fire . Julianne does everything in her power to ruin the relationship between Michael and Kim , but everything she does only seems to bring them closer together . Her closest friend George comes to her aid , but even his help makes little impact . It is n't until Julianne goes too far that she realizes if she truly loves this man , she just may need to let him go . The performances are all top notch , especially from Roberts , Diaz and Everett . Julia is always a delight , and her catty humor here is brilliantly sarcastic and genuine to say the least . The one fault I found with this film aside from the corny opening sequences is that the character of Julianne is almost so evil you forget that you are supposed to like her . Julia does her best to make this character relatable and likable , but the script does n't help her out too much and we wind up hating her in parts . Sure , she turns around in the end and earns our love , but getting there can be rough . Diaz and Everett have our unwavering love and devotion throughout the entire film though , each of them delivering spunky , funny and honest performances . Diaz is a comedic gem who devours her `ditzy girl ' character with warmth and Everett takes his `sidekick ' character to another level with scene stealing wit and comedic timing the whole `singing in the restaurant ' and the last dance scene are prime examples of his brilliance . I 'm really not a fan of Mulroney . He 's serviceable , but that 's about it . He was really the other misstep . I just did n't find him interesting enough to be the object of these two women 's affections . Both women , in their own ways , are real catches . Julianne is confident and successful and devoted , and Kim is beautiful and spontaneous and vibrant . Michael was kind of a dud . It 's a good thing the film is less interested in him and more interested in the other characters . I will say , I really enjoyed this movie . Sure , I hated Julianne in parts , but maybe that was the point I do n't think it was , but the minor misstep is forgivable in the end . The script is really funny , and that makes up for a lot `` I could be jello '' . I recommend this movie to any fan of the genre or the star , for Roberts is at the top of her game .",m,1
"I love this movie ! ! One of my all time favorite movies with a bitter sweet ending so to speak . I love all the actresses actors that are in it , they did a great job ! !",f,1
"Julia Robert 's character , Julianne , sums up the entire movie in one line near the end ; 'Since I got here , I have done nothing but underhanded , despicable , not even terribly imaginative things . 'That 's not to say that there are not some very funny moments in this movie , most of which are musical . The opening credits are a brilliant rendition of `` Wishin ' and a Hopin ' , the karaoke bar scene where a young , scene-stealing Cameron Diaz puts everything into an off-key , `` Do n't know what to do with myself '' , the restaurant scene with a wonderful ensemble `` Say a Little Prayer . `` Heck , even the helium-balloon singing is funny . But overall the movie consists of watching as Julia Robert 's character does 'nothing but underhanded , despicable , not even terribly imaginative things ' , before the obvious redemption at the end .",m,0
"Julianne Potter Julia Roberts has everything that is required to be a romantic comedy heroine - wild hair , a huge smile , a gay best friend Rupert Everett and a dilemma in her love life . Her best friend ex-boyfriend , Michael Dermot Mulroney has just called her out of the blue , leaving a message on her answermachine telling her to call him - urgently . < p > Julianne remembers that years ago , she and Michael vowed to marry each other if they were both still single at 28 . She 's going to turn 28 , and leaps to a happy conclusion . However , on returning his call , he drops the bombshell - he 's getting married to somebody else . This weekend . Well , what 's a girl to do ? Armed with her afore-mentioned gay best friend , George , Julianne sets off to Chicago to see what she can do about breaking up the couple and securing Michael for herself . < p > His fianc & eacute ; e , Kimmy Cameron Diaz is 20 years old and Barbie doll perfect . She does n't even have a tiny flaw that Julianne can use against her . She is extra-super-nice to Julianne , giving her the position of Maid Of Honour within half an hour of meeting her and bringing all the defences down to admit to her that she is jealous of her relationship with Michael . < p > Julianne is ruthless . She 'll do whatever it takes to get Michael back - and she does a lot of it . She tries to embarrass Kimmy at a karaoke bar , but despite a terrible singing voice Kimmy has chutzpah and wins the audience around . In a bid to make Michael jealous , she convinces George to pose as her husband which he does with pizzazz describing their first meeting , he muses wistfully , `` I knew we 'd end up like this - like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza '' . And finally she writes a nasty email to Michael 's boss , supposedly from Kimmy 's father . < p > This is the turning point of the movie . Up until now we have seen Julianne as the heroine and Kimmy as the foe who must be obliterated at all costs . And this is perhaps where we realise that maybe this is n't just another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . But now , maybe we do n't want Julianne to win any more . Maybe , just maybe , sweet Kimmy should be the one to end up with Michael . It 's not so clear-cut now , and the script keeps us guessing until the end . < p > Roberts gives a great performance here , making Julianne sympathetic even when we do n't like her very much . She does n't have much chemistry with Mulroney as Michael , but then nor does Diaz ; perhaps this is the point of the movie . However it is Rupert Everett who manages to steal almost every scene he is in . It 's very enjoyable , and slightly black - but only if you want to see that side of it . One to watch .",f,1
"OK , so the restaurant scene where everyone breaks out singing & quot ; I Say A Little Prayer & quot ; is cute . But this is NOT the strikingly original comedy it 's touted to be . I mean , it ends with a chase scene for crying out loud and who but Julia Roberts would not be facing grand theft auto -- or grand theft bread van -- charges after such a stunt . From the director of the delightfully off-beat & quot ; Muriel 's Wedding , & quot ; I expected more . Well , it is possible to do weddings to death and maybe that much can be said of P . J . Hogan 's directorial efforts . < p > The attractive cast and the occasional chuckle make & quot ; My Best Friend 's Wedding & quot ; worth seeing -- once ! Unless you 're a die-hard Julia Roberts or Cameron Diaz fan , it 's hard to imagine wanting to own a copy .",m,0
"MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING is definitely my favorite wedding film . With an all-star cast including Julia Roberts , Dermot Mulroney , Cameron Diaz , and Rupertt Everett , it makes this film even more worth-watching . Julianne Roberts is a food critic who soon realizes she loves her best friend , Michael Mulroney , the day he decides to marry Kim , a perky blonde from a very wealthy family Diaz . Determinded to win him back , Julianne will do anything to break up the couple 's wedding - and she only has four days , with the help of her . . . friend , George Everett . Every scheme to win Michael back is , of course , hilarious . < p > MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING is an excellent , feel-good romantic comedy about one who finds true love for the right person at the wrong time . Will Julianne win Michael ? You 'll have to see this to learn the answer ! But it 's actually very surprising at the end . This film is very original , too . This film is definitely worth watching !",f,1
"In my opinion , it is n't the character played by Dermot Mulroney who is the best friend of Julia Roberts ' character . It is Rupert Everett , her gay friend . It is Rupert who flys out to support her in her travail over Mulroney 's upcoming marriage , giving her his time , his care and his affection . What an amazing person ! I love Julia Roberts and go to any movie she makes , but the character she plays in this movie is immature and not very sympathetic . However , it is the very immaturity of her character that leads to all the conflict , so I ca n't complain too much ! Overall , the movie has some extremely funny moments .",f,1
This movie is great . I have watched it several times . The acting is great and there is alot of fun to be had .,f,1
"I have to agree with the analysis of a recent reviewer who points out the self-centeredness of the lead characters in this Chicago-based tale . Food critic Julianne Potter Julia Roberts and sports broadcaster , Michael O'Neil Dermot Mulroney had promised while in college that they would marry each other if neither had married before they were 28 , which right there makes love seem like a game where they are concerned . But three weeks before Julianne is to turn 28 , Michael announces his engagement to a 20-year-old college student named Kimberly Wallace the always sunny Cameron Diaz , much to Julianne 's dismay , and realizing her own feelings for Michael , tries to sabotage the impending nuptials -- a scenario which , with the skillful writing of Ronald Bass and the skillful direction of P . J . Hogan becomes one of humor and pathos , rather than just one of completely outright meanness and manipulation . Kimberly embraces Julianne , and after knowing her only a few minutes , makes her her Maid of Honor , a role she pretends to play while trying to create friction between the couple , using various methods , and lastly employing her gay friend , George Downes Rupert Everett to pose as her fiance , hoping to make Michael jealous . Much of this film 's entertainment value comes from the well-chosen cast . Philip Bosco and Susan Sullivan portray the bride 's dignified parents Walter and Isabelle Wallace , Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston are Samantha and Mandy Newhouse , like-dressing characters from the South , who will also serve as bridesmaids , Chris Masterson as the Best Man-to-be is a fairly shy , and awkward youth , although , along with a few peer group members , he gives one of the most amusing scenes in the movie , which involves helium , Paul Giamatti plays Richard , an empathetic bellman , Harry Shearer plays Jonathan P . F . Ritt , and M . Emmett Walsh plays Joe O'Neal . More delightful moments occur during an outing at a seafood restaraunt , where , while conjuring up a story behind their fake engagement , George leads everyone in singing Dionne Warwick 's `` I Say a Little Prayer '' , and when one of the bridesmaids gets her tongue stuck on an ice sculpture . Things come to a head when Julianne follows George 's advice and finally reveals her true feelings as Kimberly stumbles upon the scene , and a viewer can only hope for some just resolution . For me , this film has called to mind the lyrics of a 1958 song by Don Cornell called `` Play Some Music for Broken Hearts '' , in which the final stanza is : `` Play some music for broken hearts . Play it slower and slower . For our love is over , and tonight we must part . . . `` Maybe it was n't love . Maybe it was just more a desire to always win at all costs . But it was time for something definite to be done about Michael and Julianne 's relationship , and at least someone got to dance at the other 's wedding .",f,1
"This is a fun movie and will hold the attention of most female viewers ; my wife thoroughly enjoyed the movie and watched it to the very end . Julia Roberts as Julianne Potter is a touching character who has a real problem making up her mind as to what kind of a friend she wants her best friend to be . Her best friend , Michael O'Neal , played by Dermot Mulroney just happens to be a guy she 's known for many years . Things go along OK until he announces his intentions of getting married ; that announcement triggers a strong reaction that serves as the basis for the movie . Although the movie is a bit dated , it 's still funny and engaging to watch . It may be good to watch it once just to see what you think about it before buying . On the other hand why not just roll the dice , pay your $ 7 . 36 and get a new copy of your very own ? If you have any women in the household you should be on safe ground .",m,1
"HYPOTHERMIA is one of those `` creature features '' that would have been more successful had the film gone more humorous or campy . Unfortunately , the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver 's suit ! Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes . Blood and gore are utilized but tame compared to current standards . At only 73 minutes , HYPOTHERMIA passes quickly , so it might work as a double bill on Halloween !",m,0
"Being a big time horror fan and a diehard collector I love this movie alot , the acting and special effects were right on point . You encounter a lake monster in the dead winter was a brilliant idea and concept , the monster effects was hands down freaking awesome and unique . Hypothermia is a downright horror science fiction monster you must have in your collection of monster films . Having this film in my horror collection is truly a honor , hats off to MPI Media Group , Glass Eye Pix and Dark Sky Films for bringing and distributing this film to horror fans like myself who live and breathe horror films . Hypothermia gets 2 thumps , a perfection 10 and 5 stars . . . HYPOTHERMIA KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE GENRE OF MONSTER HORROR FILMS :",m,1
"Visually masterful underground cinema . The bleak , but beautiful setting of the frozen lake is warped by a minimalistic luciferian score . The pacing is hypnotic , at times slow , but meditative . I enjoyed the plot , which was a tongue-in-cheek combination of fishing , family drama , and horror . It was a weird mix of exactly what you 'd expect and complete ridiculousness . It could use some more tits and more gore , but maybe that will happen in part 2 . The acting is b-movie camp outside of Michael Rooker and Amy Chang . You 've got to listen closely to grab some of the bizarre stuff the characters say with straight faces . It seems that swimming below the traditional genre flourishes there is a subversive social message . I definitely did n't watch it for the relevant message , but instead enjoyed it for the eerie tension and creepiness . This is my favorite McKenney film with Automatons trailing close behind it .",m,1
"I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks ' The Mahabharata on DVD , and today it arrived . How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS . I have not watched this version yet , but I can not believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc . So a warning to everyone : if you want the full miniseries , THIS IS NOT IT !",m,0
"I was raised on stories from the Mahbharata and my parents showed me this movie when I was about ten years old . Even though it is low budget and very , very long , I loved it . I started showing it to my friends , who have no Indian background or knowledge at all and they loved it too . I 'll never forget when we were about thirteen years old we started watching it at a sleepover and were too tired to finish . In order to see the whole thing before our moms came to take us home we would have to wake up at 6:00 am . I decided we would schedule the rest for another time , since sleeping in is a part of a sleepover . To my surprise my friends all woke up at 6:00 to see the rest . It is an amazing story that grows bigger than itself somehow .",f,1
"I can not comment on how faithful this is to the original . Nor can I comment on whether or not it may or may not be offensive to Hindus . I do n't know . I hope it is n't , however , because it is certainly a beautiful work of theatre as art . My family begged me to watch this for years and years , but with raising a family , I just did n't have a spare 5-6 hours . Recently , however , I finally had time -- and it was so worth it . The performance was so finely acted and directed . I think especially of the brother who tells a lie for the first time . How he touches his lip after the words are spoken , amazed that untruth could come out of his mouth . I think about the actor who played Krishna -- Wow ! And especially , the actor who plays the old blind king . That is just so well done . At any rate , if it is offensive to Hindus , then do n't see it . But if it is n't , then it is truly worth the time .",f,1
"Mahabharata , directed by Peter Brook , is a great movie . It is a must see for all who are interested in epic mythology and who would like to understand more about the religious philosophies and culture of India . As an Indian I have heard countless stories about Mahabharata and seen many Indian movies based on Mahabharata . The story is vast and often spawned many discussions on arguments on why things were what they were - the plot , chartecters , etc . I first saw the theatrical version of the Peter Brook version in 1989 , and was amazed by the beauty and grandeur of the production and also was quite impressed how effectively the strory was told and enacted by an international cast of stage and screen actors . Mahabharata is a must collect item and worth watching once every year ! ! !",m,1
"Many reviews here deplore the butchered three-hour version with good reason . Be sure to scroll down to the DVD details to make sure you are getting the six-hour version . There is a Hindi version of this great epic , which was very popular in India , but it is extremely long , with many digressions that Western audiences will find distracting . The Peter Brook version has been painstakingly translated and designed and made accessible to a modern Western audience , much the way Laurence Olivier did with his Shakespeare movies . For those with intelligence and sensibility -- i . e . for adults -- this is one of the most profound stories they will ever see . For those without -- i . e . for adolescents -- it will be a bore . The Mahabharata is longer than and as ancient as the Bible . Some of the parallels between the two are too close to be mere coincidence : the Trinity , virgin birth , prophecy , someone who is born and raised like Moses but is given a different role to play by destiny . The story of Krishna in the complete Mahabharata not included in the Brook even parallels that of Jesus . It is no coincidence that both Krishna and Jesus are called `` Lord '' . Although the Mahabharata is indeed a `` secular '' history , it contains within it the most sacred of all Hindu texts , the Bhagavad Gita , with its universal precepts . This is the story upon which an entire civilization bases its culture . For Peter Brook to bring its essence to a beautifully staged play is a stupendous achievement . His eclectic casting may not be to everybody 's liking , and sometimes the accents are a bit thick . But the acting itself is fine . By the way , the father of mankind is . . . the storyteller . See this . It can change your life .",m,1

In one case , I watched all 6 hours straight through minus bathroom breaks of course . Another reviewer used the phrase & quot ; life changing & quot ; , and I agree completely . I have continued to draw inspiration from this film for 5 years . With the DVD , maybe I can go for another 50 . PS : The soundtrack for this film is out on RealWorld . Also recommended .",m,1
"THE DVD I GOT IS NOT VERY GOOD , IT DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND THE IMAGE IS BLURRY , BUT IS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I TRIED TO GET THIS PRODUCT , SO I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME . THANK YOU , BEATRIZ BELTRAN .",f,1
"I did n't realize how good 'Song of Norway ' was until I watched this film , which is almost as bad as Gilliam 's 'Jabberwocky ' . Peter Brook , like Terry Gilliam , is one of the great charlatans of our time . Each man is a self-important destroyer of good literature . Whatever Gilliam touches he turns into boring uncleanness . Whatever Brook touches he turns into a model of his own ininteresting self . There is neither health nor beauty in Brook 's 'Mahabharata ' . If you want to watch a proper 'Mahabarata ' , get the Chopra version . Brook 's 'international ' version is squalid , boring , and all wrong . It will be enjoyed only by the illiterate and the perverse . Let me say something in passing . The RSC has been for at least three decades an example of all that is bad in the modern arts world . When will British critics stop treating it as a divine manifestation ? We British have suffered horribly at the hands of our home-grown 'talents ' since the 1960s . Some day we 'll get a healthy-minded director who will make faithful films of the John Buchan novels . Many of us are fed up with directors whose minds are unclean and utterly dull . The duty of a film-maker is to enchant , to entertain : but Peter Brook has no sense of duty , and so his 'Mahabharata ' has zero entertainment value .",m,0
"In reading the positive reviews of the movie , I was wondering if one needed to take some kind of exotic drugs to write them , and then I wondered would n't it be easier just to take the drugs and forget the movie ? Honestly , this one of the worst films I have ever seen since `` Plan 9 From Outer Space '' and the `` Freddy Got Fingered . `` The production values were poor to say the least . It was hard to identify the the characters and their motivations because no one stands out . Most of the characters were pretty uninteresting or strange , i . e . , the woman who gave birth to a bowling ball for example . [ Seriously , it is in there . I 'm not making it up . ] I could not figure out the lineages of the families because they were a pretty mixed group . There was even a Kung Fu master in the film and that part was a bit like Kung Fu meets the Sons of Hercules . Which begs the question , if you are going to have a Kung Fu master why not attack helicopters and rocket grenades , too ? Could any film be worse ? No , actually -- this is pretty bad . It is like watching a bad Star Trek movie if you are n't a fan of Star Trek or familiar with the myth or back-story . One point the woman 's future husband is blind so she chooses to wear a blindfold for the rest of her life . What that accomplishes I do n't know but there it is . If you like really bad gladiator movies , this could be your film . Yikes !",m,0
"Warning to Moms of young children . I let my 4 year watch this movie . She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying `` I Hate My Life '' .

My biggest complaint with this Barbie movie is the line from Barbies guy friend expressing excitement at walking in on a `` girl hug '' . Do we really need that kind of suggestive remark in a Barbie movie aimed at girls ages 5 to 12 ?,f,0
"This movie is inappropriate for young children under 8 for whom the other Barbie Princess movies were the target audience . We received as a gift and I 'm sure the giver thought this movie would be in line with the others . It is not due to very inappropriate messages : 1 If your make-up gets confiscated , keep extra hidden in the pocket of your coat . 2 Getting boys to like you is most important in High School . 3 Getting boys to kiss you is even more important . 4 Getting good grades will make everyone hate you . These things may happen in high school , but this is n't an appropriate message for 5 year olds . Shame on Barbie , shame on Mattel !",f,0
"< a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B003U0AAJ8 '' > The Barbie Diaries : Widescreen Edition < a > The movie over all was pretty good in my opinion . The story line was n't really original but interesting enough to keep me watching . It 's a typical high school movie . Barbie starts a new year in high school . Barbie has a crush on the most popular guy in school . Barbie has an enemy who is dating her crush . All those kind of stuff . Aside from the story line , the animation was okay . I felt as though the background clothes were bland . It was like the creators only focused on making the main characters look cool that they were too lazy to design the background people . The best part of the movie in my opinion was the music . I enjoyed the beginning and ending music a lot . The beginning music was called `` This is Me '' by Skye Sweetman . Overall the movie taught the old moral of `` believing in yourself '' and showed the stereotypical view of high school . There is really no original idea in the movie . If you like the stereotypical , this movie is for you . But if you want something more original , try something else .",f,0
"The animation is jerky , Barbie looks odd and nothing like herself . She 's portrayed as a highschool student , but acts like a middelschool student . Poorly written , poorly animated . My 8 year old daughter loves Barbie movies , and she asked me if we could send this one back .",f,0
"My daughter loves the Barbie DVD 's , this one included , but I definitely think it 's aimed towards an older audience than my 4 year old daughter . That being said , she still highly enjoyed it I think mostly because of the music and it was worth every penny to see the smile on her face when she watched it . I was disappointed by the graphics on it though . The other Barbie movies appear to be made better than this one as far as the graphics go .",f,0
shows those avid barbie fans that growing up is sometimes hard but that things work out when you believe in yourself,f,0
I am the mother of a Barbie-obsessed 4-year-old and bought this unaware of the plot . I like the movie but think it 's too mature for my daughter right now . It would be great for a girl in middle school however . I did find it entertaining .,f,1
"I got this for my 7 year old daughter . She thinks boys have cooties at this age . Especially her brothers . I did take away one star for the `` girl hug '' comment because I thought it probably went a little too far in a movie that is geared towards a younger crowd . It was okay , though , because it went WAY over her head . However , hormones were n't the only message . What I liked was the message that the popular kids were only popular because they said nasty things about each other . I liked that Barbie learned that the hunky guy on the rebound was n't the boy who made her feel the best deep down in her heart . I liked that Barbie wrote down her wishes and made them come true . I got this movie yesterday afternoon . My daughter has already watched this movie three times . She dug through her stuff to find her charm bracelet and has been scribbling in a notebook all day long .",f,1
"Personally thought this was a great film , most young girls or teens can relate toThe graphics are probably the best yet out of the rest of the barbie moviesI also did not think that the movie was too mature for young audiences as a previous reviewer statedThe scene when Kevin commented on the girls hugging was n't in any way , shape or form meant to be crudeAnyone should be able to see , that Kevin only tries to find ways to be get barbie to realize how much he loves her . It saddens me , to see that someone could have such a negative outlook over such innocent emotionsI suppose it 's because of reviews like that , why television cencors everything now days",m,1
"Honestly , I like ALL the Barbie movies . They are a little cheezy and have fun story lines that anyone can enjoy . But this one is differnt . First of all , it has a GREAT soundtrack ! I absolutely love the music . I 'm 26 years old and would have the songs on my playlist and no one would ever know it was from a Barbie movie if they had n't seen it . This movie is geared toward older kids , but my younger kids love it as well . I also like the movie . Having to on occasion watch a movie 20 times in a row , having a movie you can enjoy can really help ease the pain of repetitive movies . The story line is a lot better than some of the fantasy based ones . The dialog is fun and more mature . All in all , great movie !",f,1
"I 'm a teenager and I love Barbie movies ! I also collect Barbies . I think that all of the previous , fantasy-like Barbie Movies are very nice . When i first heard the idea of this movie , I really did n't like the sound of the fact that it was going to have Barbie in school . I liked the storyline , and fantasy of the rest of the movies . It sort of makes little kids think the wrong things about high school ; its all about liking boys , and you do n't have to do school work , and you do n't have to work hard .",f,0
The acting and story are superb . Blending a great western and history lesson in the what occurred in the late 1800 's . If you are a Robert Duvall fan you will love it !,m,1
"ROBERT DUVALL IS GOOD IN ALL THE MOVIES HE HAS MADE . THIS IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST WITH ACTION , LOVE INTEREST AND SUPPORT FROM HIS CO-ACTORS . THIS IS RIGHT UP WITH ASSINATION TANGO . THANKS MR DUVALL",m,1
"1 . I watched half of this via cable while on the road and was so intrigued by it that I got the DVD later on . 2 . Others have mentioned the pros cons of this movie ; I just think it 's one of the best Westerns out there -- > great acting , a definite unique twist to the usual Western storyline , and it 's based I do n't know how loosely on a true story . 3 . A definite 5 star .",m,1
An awesome movie . I had seen it twice and decided I had to own it !,f,1
"I thought good westerns died with John Wayne , but this movie will rank high with the classic westerns of yesteryear . Robert Duvall has true grit .",m,1
"Walter Hill 's Broken Trail is a good but at times a little too leisurely Western miniseries following Robert Duvall and his nephew Thomas Haden Church as they try to drive a herd of horses across country only to become sidetracked when they find themselves the unlikely guardians of five Chinese girls being shipped to a brothel - and the target of some bad men determined to relieve them of both . . . It 's curious how Robert Duvall , and actor who came to prominence playing a mob lawyer who deposited horses heads in peoples ' beds , has evolved into the kind of archetypal Western figure of unquestioned decency you 'd be happy to trust your life to - even more so when you remember he tried to kill John Wayne in True Grit ! If he shoots someone seemingly out of the blue , you know it 's someone who needs shooting although much of the action takes place offscreen such is his moral stature . By contrast , Church seems uncomfortable and out of place - he does well enough , but they never strike the sparks that made Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones ' relationship in Lonesome Dove so memorable and affecting . And Lonesome Dove does unfortunately cast a giant shadow over this : it may be a smaller story , but , especially after Open Range , you expect more when Duvall gets in the saddle . Despite that , it 's an engaging enough amble and extremely well made . Hill is one of the few working directors who still know the power of an extreme long shot , giving the show an occasional sense of the epic , though this is sometimes undercut by the fact that he generally plays his scenes in medium shots . More focused than his intriguing but scattershot Wild Bill but less impressive than The Long Riders or his under-rated Geronimo : An American Legend , it 's worth a look , but you might just want to spread it over a couple of nights .",m,0
"A very good western , with somewhat of a chick flick imbedded , meaning my wife enjoyed it too .",m,1
This movie looks so good on Blu-ray Disc . The Story is Good ! ! ! So own Broken Trail today .,m,1
"If there are any actors today that can fit into chaffs and cowboy boots , they would be Clint Eastwood & Robert Duvall . Duvall has stated in an interview that of all the roles he has played as a character actor , none fit him better than that of a cowboy . This film is in a sense a continuation of his roles from `` Lonesome Dove '' to `` Open Range '' in which he plays a seasoned cowboy who has to fight the bitter elements , human and natural , in order to get the job done . Duvall is ably supported here by Thomas Haden Church who in a break from his comedic roles , is excellent as his long estranged nephew who joins him on the cattle drive . With excellent direction from long time vet Walter Hill and some fine support from Greta Scacchi as a former prostitute with a yen for Duvall , and James Russo & Chris Mulkey as the villains -- '' Broken Trail '' is a trip you do n't want to end despite its length I saw a pre-screening of it before its showing on AMC with Hill in attendance and was impressed .",m,1
"I absolutely loved this movie . I 'm not a big fan of westerns , but this movie was different . It actually had depth to it and was n't just some gunslinging western . I liked the little romance part and the way things ended between Tom and Sun Foy .",f,1
"Broken Trail : better than Open Range , not quite as good as Lonesome Dove , but all in all , a very satisfying western . If Robert Duval wanted to be judged by any three movies which are quintessentially American , I do n't think he could do better than these . [ After a terribly slow first half , Open Range does speed up and Duval makes the turn very meaningful . ] With large sections of Broken Trail seen through the youg Chinese girls ' eyes and spirits , we get a slightly different view of the Old West than we have perhaps had . And that is a good thing . Church and Duval make a great family pairing . I believed they could be related and Church 's portrayal of the quiet-spoken man of action and principle is spot-on and a far cry from his Cowboy character in Tombstone . Excellent scenery and photography - the cinematographer needs an award for this production as well ; solid , not flashy direction , and a supporting cast that fit smoothly into the story , all make this a movie I bought as soon as it was available . I knew I would buy it after watching the first part on its television debut . The only slightly annoying aspect of the movie experience is the blackouts for the commercial breaks . Other than that , if you like Westerns , as I do , including every 'B ' movie western ever made , you will love Broken Trail .",m,1
"I really enjoyed the entire DVD but being an old time traditionalist , I was not happy with the ending which was just plain depressing . Robert Duvall has now set the standard for resurrecting the old time westerns and proves that there is a demand for good quality movies not depending on sex or excessive violence in order to garner viewers . . . . . . . . . Mr . Duvall has now become one of my favorite actors and joins my other favorite Tom Selleck . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",m,1
This is a movie well worth watching over and over it is a clean exciting movie that leaves you wanting more of the same . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000GFRI4K '' > Broken Trail < a > As always Robert Duvall out does himself once again . A must watch for anyone who loves westerns .,f,1
"This movie was recommended to me by a friend as one I would like being a big Western fan especially of more modern Westerns ! I bought this Blu-Ray with nothing else to go on and it was pretty good . I did n't realize that it is a two disc two-part movie and it is quite long , but despite that it is a good and entertaining story",m,1
"A must see for anyone who enjoys Robert DuVall . Great cast . . . . and oh what a lovely story . Well worth seeing even if you 're not a `` cowboy '' so to speak . So get out the popcorn and watch a spectacular movie , the story line just keeps you right in the movie .",f,1
"Love Robert Duvall and in this movie he is at his best . He looks to be a real horseman as I have known quite a few in my day . Very authentic . Well made movie with beautiful scenery . As a matter of fact , I think we 'll watch it again tonight .",f,1
"Great western , heartwarming , with strong story line and characters . It 's hard to find a western , that 's really good anymore . Thumbs up .",f,1
". . . and you 're likely to have a masterpiece on your hands . That was true of `` Tender Mercies , `` `` Lonesome Dove , `` and `` Open Range , `` and it 's also true of `` Broken Trail , `` Walter Hill 's mesmerizing , exquisitely photographed Western miniseries about a couple of cowboys -- uncle and nephew -- who come to the rescue of five Chinese girls who were sold into prostitution . Duvall 's Print Ritter ca n't help but remind you of `` Lonesome Dove 's '' Gus McCrae or `` Open Range 's '' Boss Spearman , but at the same time Print is very different from Gus or Boss in subtle ways that only a master actor such as Duvall can make clear . `` Broken Trail '' is magnificently acted throughout . Thomas Haden Church forgoes his usual goofy persona as Print 's nephew Tom Harte , in a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a brave , sad cowboy , downtrodden by life yet beholden to no one . Chris Mulkey -- bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late Howard Duff -- is properly loathsome as the outlaw `` Big Ear '' Ed Bywaters , and Greta Scacchi is deeply moving as Nola , a hard-luck woman menaced by Bywaters and enamored of Print . Viewers might complain that the young Chinese women do n't becomne very individualized , but -- given the movie 's realism in showing that the girls ca n't speak English or comprehend Wild West culture -- that was probably inevitable . Alan Geoffrion -- who also wrote the original novel of `` Open Range '' -- provides a screenplay that is n't all happily-ever-after , but is satisfyingly poignant and filled with rich dialogue and characterizations . `` Broken Trail '' is a must-see for Robert Duvall fans and Western fans alike .",m,1
"I fell in love with this movie . The cinematography is beautiful and the setting is idyllic . Robert Duval proved once again what depth he has as an actor . He is a true story teller with his craft . I had n't seen the supporting actor , Thomas Hayden Church in anything other than `` Sideways '' and was skeptical about him pulling off the role of Robert Duval 's nephew . He surprised me with his believable character . The story is truly remarkable when you consider that it is based on real lives . Is that a spoiler ? I highly recommend this movie !",f,1
"This is one of the best Westerns to come out in several years . It reminds me of of some of the older Westerns , great story and great acting . You ca n't beat Robert Duvall , he just makes you believe he 's an old Cowboy . Thomas Haden Church missed his calling , he could have made some good Westerns over the years . The only problem is nobody writes enough good ones these days . Hopefully THC will get that chance to make a few more in his career .",m,1
"This in one of the best westerns of the modern era . I was a stuntman in Hollywood during the 50 's when the western was it 's most popular . I worked on some huge projects but none as good as todays western . Broken Trail in as good as . . . . . or better , then OPEN RANGE , THE UNFORGIVEN or SILVERADO . Duvall is the `` real '' western cowboy . I worked with him on THE PURSUIT OF D . B . COOPER in 1980 and it does n't appear that he has changed hardly at all . I recommend this film and guarantee you will watch it over and over .",m,1
I was introduced to this mini series via the Louis L'Amour discussion forum and buying via amazon let me get the story before it was even considered for distribution in Australasia . The filming and locations for this story are magnificent and this is equalled by the quality of the cast and story line . The use of subtitles and script in mandarin are no hinderance to the story . Can highly recommend the purchase of this DVD,m,1
"Great Movie , showing how ordinary people can show and practice human kindness and compassion to those less fortunate . A must see for movie buffs .",f,1
"After viewing the excellent saga of `` Lonesome Dove '' & `` Streets of Laredo '' I looked forward with anticipation to this Movie of the old west . Especially when it stars Robert Duvall , a most underrated actor . Well I was n't disappointed , it 's a great movie , which puts John Waynes West in a totally different catagary . Another underrated actor in my opinion is James Garner who played Tommy lee Jones part I believe in Streets of Laredo . I must admit though I was not impressed with `` Return to Lonesome Dove '' . also I liked `` Open Range '' All these movie give to me a more accurate idea of what the west was really like",m,1
"Broken Trail is a well produced Duvall film , not avaiable in Australia . Was very pleased to obtain it via Amazon , your service is impeccable . Not so pleased to recieve the DVD 's still in USA format , but got over this by burning them into a format suitable for Australian equipment . Suggest you may take this into account when processing future orders .",m,1

"I recently have been enjoying Westerns , and I ordered Broken Trail . Great performances from the whole cast , and lovely scenery too . Robert DuVall and Thomas Hayden Church are terrific in this unique , compelling story -- which is based on a true story .

"This is one of Robert Duvall 's best performances . If you are a fan , this is a must have . You 'll want to have this in your collection .",m,1
"This is an amazing story of principles and dedication . The filmography was beautiful . The only thing that was off was it seemed to drag in places and there were those relatively long fade out and ins between scenes . I understand that this film was made to be a mini-series and when someone is watching it over several days or weeks depending on the showing schedule one needs these repetitive shots of a horse drive slowly making its way across the country side to set the scene for each series . No one ever went across the planes with several hundred horses and a wagon full of young girls very quickly . So this is a wonderfully crafted movie asside from the long fade in and outs ; it probably works better on TV over time than on my computer , viewing it at one sitting . One more little thing about the script . Why did it say there were 500 horses when they only used about 100 or so to do the film ? It would have been OK to just say 200 and it would have been just as impressive . Still , it was a beautiful film !",f,1
"This was a good movie , all 3 hours of it . I would highly recommend it to any western fan .",f,1
Very good -- never saw it when it first came out -- do n't know how I missed it .,f,1
"Beginning with his role as Augustes McCrae in Lonesome Dove 1989 , Robert Duvall has carved out his place in western cinimatic history as the Ultimate American Cowboy . This is not to be confused with the great personae that a certain Mr . Eastwood , among others , has created during his remarkable film career . We 're not talking about the `` man with no name '' that is today 's hero , but rather the real cowboy that would also have been revered in his own time . In Broken Trail , Robert Duvall continues his portrayal of the sage old cowboy who is frought with human frailties , yet hard-edged enough to survive the dangers of his period . Just watch for Duvall 's mouth movements such as spitting , chewing or the one-handed smoothing his mustache with a bit of saliva . He is THE GREAT AMERICAN COWBOY and this wonderfully crafted western should be watched just for Robert Duvall 's presence .",m,1
"I acted in this movie , so I am alittle biased , but it was not what I had thought , more drama , less action , but a good movie all the same",m,1
"I would compare this movie to BBC Planet Earth . Both films are great , have a lot of amazing shots and a few not so amazing . My machine plays this movie at about half of computing power , electricity is filtered , HDTV used as monitor calibrated with Spider2Express . This Blu-ray release is not as good as 3:10 To Yuma . I would still recommend this purchase .",m,1
Robert Duvall - his usual superb self in the role of a western character . High praise also for Thomas Haden Church . . . . . splendid performance .,f,1

"My ex-wife turned-me-on to Westerns , which were not high on my hit list before giving-in to her , Yes , I was a easy mark for a sweet voice and and a pretty face , unfortunately it was n't hers and she ditched me when I remembered who 's it was that raced my heart ! Tami , if you ever read this I am sorry for any embarassment it brings you , you know it 's All true , so do n't damn me , please ? Anyway , once I made the conversion from Comedy to Western , I found Robert Duvall to be the epiome of a Western Hero . Perhaps who Willie Nelson was thinking of when he wrote M Heros Have Always Been Cowboys This is one of Duvall 's finest , watch it , enjoy it and never forge Tami , I wo n't !",m,1
The movie was for my grandmother for Christmas . She loved it . . . . . . into Westerns .,f,1
I anticipated a great movie because Robert Duvall is in it . After seeing Open Range I was ready for another great western . I was really enjoying the movie until it just up and ended after the girls were being rescued again . There they are fleeing town and the credits start rolling . Talk about being ripped .,m,0
An interesting western but filled with nudity and actions that bring the quality of he movie down . The acting was less than smooth . Two cowboys save five chinese girls and have to take them cross country with them on their cattle drive . I ca n't recommend this movie to any one .,f,0
"First , let me say the actors and production crew on BROKEN TRAIL do an admirable job on this film . Everyone , and I mean EVERYONE does an outstanding job in bringing this film to the screen . But Canada , was chosen , rather than the USA , for actors , production crew and location . These production companies generate alot of money to the local economy . But the locales of the story are supposed to be Oregon and Wyoming . Why was a foreign country chosen instead ? Is this because locations and talent were not available or suitable in Oregon or Wyoming ? No . Were it that simple . It 's because of greed . Because of taxes and other incentives , many American directors and producers work in Canada because it 's cheaper . Duvall , who is `` Executive Producer '' and director Walter Hill , felt they could do it cheaper and better outside the USA to make more profits and work with the people they 've done so on so many other films shot in Canada . How much money do these guys need ! ! ! ! ? I 'm surprised at Duvall as he is so pro-american being a staunch Republican . Wake up everybody . We are losing so much of America including even the western through more `` outsourcing '' and what Duvall proudly calls `` our greatest American heritage '' .",m,0
"`` Broken Trail '' , a dream project for producer star Robert Duvall , and AMC 's first original film , is the spiritual heir to Kevin Costner 's 2003 `` Open Range '' also starring Duvall , and one of the most moving , involving Westerns of recent years . With a charismatic , extremely effective performance by Thomas Haden Church , as Duvall 's long-estranged nephew , the film is one of only a handful of Westerns that combine epic sweep , superb characterization , and an understanding of the 'Real West ' , without shortchanging decency , or respect of an individual 's worth . The era was hard , justice could be swift and brutal , and Duvall , as aging but upright Prentice Ritter , lives by his own rules ; to protect the helpless in his care , to respect others , and to be unafraid to resort to violence , if necessary . Tom Harte Church , despite some family history problems with his uncle , lives by the same code , and the two men , driving a herd of horses from Oregon to Wyoming to raise cash for a ranch , become the 'saviors ' of five young Chinese women , sold into prostitution , who inadvertently fall into their hands . These are good men , in a jaded world , and their journey picks up other 'strays ' , as well as the women ; young Virginian fiddler Heck Gilpin an engaging Scott Cooper , is rescued by Tom in a saloon ; aging Chinese laborer Lung Hay Donald Fong , and careworn prostitute Nola John the wonderful Greta Scacchi join the group after Tom saves the Chinese women from rapists , in a boarding house bordello . While neither Ritter and Harte were overjoyed at the strange direction the drive was taking , they would not allow harm to fall on 'innocents ' , and the group bonds into a warm 'family ' , with Nola and Ritter finding a mature attraction between each other , and Tom and Sun Foy # 3 Gwendoline Yeo , who speaks only Mandarin , in the film , gently falling in love . Danger is never far behind them , however , as brutal ex-con 'Big Ears ' Chris Mulkey , with a score to settle with Nola , and a 'contract ' to return the Chinese women to whorehouse owner Kate 'Big Rump ' Becker Rusty Schwimmer , trails them , leading a gang of killers . . . While the film is long 240 minutes , director Walter Hill , an old hand at Westerns his `` The Long Riders '' is one of my favorites , keeps the story constantly engrossing , and Duvall and Church have a warmth and authenticity as the characters that will stay with you , long after the movie ends . Shot in the Canadian Rockies , `` Broken Trail '' combines grandeur and intimacy seamlessly , has moments of great humor to lighten the drama , explosive action , and a bittersweet sense of nostalgia . . . It is , simply , superb !",m,1
"I can only hope they someone keeps making Westerns because the few that have been made the last few years have been outstanding . This one , a TV miniseries , is just great . I ca n't say enough good things about it . I saw it recently on DVD . It was a three-hour film . I thought I read somewhere that it was four hours , so I do n't know if this version has been cut down . I only know what I saw , and I liked about everything I saw . I also knew what to expect . . . . . and that helped . I did n't expect a rough film with a ton of violence and nasty characters , language , etc . What surprised me was just how interesting a film this was for being three hours long and not having a lot of action . I attribute this to the dialog , the acting , characters you care about and the wonderful cinematography . It 's hard to beat the scenery in a nicely-filmed western . The words coming out of the two stars of the picture , Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church were extremely believable material . These guys were tough , but not abrasively- macho , compassionate but not sappy . As `` Prentice Ritter '' and `` Tom Harte , `` respectively , they fascinating to watch . I liked what they said throughout the movie and they were extremely believable characters . They looked and talked the part . This story is different because it 's mainly about helping five young Chinese women , who are destined for prostitution , slavery and who knows what else . Ritter and Harte did n't volunteer for the job ; it accidentally came upon them as they were escorting horses North for a nice payday . The two men showed wonderful compassion for these girls , despite the fact they slowed their mission down and had a problem with communication . It simple terms : this is a nice movie , a good story about good guys doing a good deed for the right reasons . Watching them do it , under adverse conditions , was almost a privilege . A big thank you to all involved with this movie and giving us fans of this genre hope that it is n't completely dead .",m,1
"Duvall is the rough around the edges , but loving grandfather-like figure you know had to exist back in those wild times of the old west . This is the 3rd and probably last western for Duvall , who has stated that Broken Trail completes his trilogy with Lonesome Dove and Open Range . Church is a tough , determined , western man who does things `` the cowboy way '' . . . he 's perfect for the part , and you 'll agree once you see him and his character . What the story lacks in action-adventure , it sure makes up for in character development , relationships , scenery , and just plain pulling you in , and making you feel like you 're actually on the horse-drive with them . And when the action does come , it 's shocking , tense , and more realistic than any western before . this movie about good honest men , doing the right thing , in a time and place where no one else did . This movie is n't just for western fans or men , but women can really get into this , as there are several female co-stars here who wrestle with the hardships of the day as seen from the eyes of a woman in the late 1800s , in the lawless west . I 've read it before on a review forum , and I agree that on a top ten list , if Lonesome Dove is a 10 , and Open Range is a 9 , then Broken Trail is an 8 or 8 & 1 2 ! ! ! I ca n't wait for this release .",m,1
"A friend loaned me this little gem when she came home after holidaying in the U . S . A . If you enjoyed Lonesome Dove and Open Range you will enjoy Broken Trail and , YES , Mr Duval does his : Gus Mcrae : again . SO WHAT ? It , s not as if it is a bad performance and it fits in with the pace of the film and the storyline . In reviewing a film i dont believe you should say a lot about the story as it could give people a pre-conceived idea about whats going to happen . Let them judge for themselves . Broken Trail is an easy , gentle , with some real dark moments , Western , with an unusual story , and some great performances particularly from Mr Church . Considering that most people would find it hard to imagine him in a western , he was excellent and portrayed a great , strong , silent , hero . Get the kids to bed , feet up and enjoy this Western . Davy , wesnut .",m,1
"For those of you who are big fans of the TV mini-series , Lonesome Dove , and the Kevin Costner movie , Open Range , here 's another one to wet your appetite with -- Broken Trail , starring the great Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church . It was only by accident I was watching the Hollywood Foreign Press Awards show a few months ago and Duvall was nominated for his role in Broken Trail that I found out about this three-hour mini-series made specifically for the American Movie Channel in 2006 . And , once I found out about it , I discovered that the mini-series was already out on DVD . Miracles do occasionally happen ! Anyway , Broken Trail is the story of Print Ritter played by Duvall who inherits his sister 's farm after she dies . Her son , Tom Harte played by Church , is left nothing because he took it upon himself to strike out on his own years earlier . Ritter meets with Harte and explains what has happen , suggesting that maybe the both of them could join together and lead a herd of 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming . Since Harte has nothing to lose , he agrees to help his uncle for twenty-five percent of the profits . In their journey across the north-western part of the country , they pick-up a Virginian gentleman fiddler named Heck Gilpin played by Scott Cooper , five abused and abandoned Chinese women who 'd been sold into a life of slavery , a prostitute with a broken nose who 's played by Greta Scacchi , and an old Chinese man played by Donald Wong . To make matters even more complicated , they 're being followed by a group of killers , led by Big Ears played by Chris Mulkey , and there will be a final showdown . Broken Trail delivers in full force with the majestic scenery of the northwest , a story of goodness battling evil with the killing fast and violent , the superb acting of both Robert Duvall and Thomas Hayden Church not to mention the rest of the cast , especially Chris Mulkey as the villain who never raises his voice , yet manages to project a true sense of evil , the eye for detail and accuracy about the Old West , and the excellent direction of Walter Hill . This is the kind of Western that you 'll want to watch over and over again with Robert Duvall playing the type of role that he was born for . The DVD extras include a twenty-minute featurette on the Making of Broken Trail . Thank God for DVDs . Now , when a truly excellent movie like Broken Trail appears on a TV station that you do n't get , all you have to do is wait for the DVD to come out . Highly recommended !",m,1
"Robert Duvall reprises his aging cowboy roles from `` Lonesome Dove '' and `` Open Range '' in this 3-hour TV western that follows not a cattle drive but the cross-country trek of a herd of mustangs from Oregon to Wyoming in the closing years of the 19th century . Many of the elements of the genre are here , including the beauty and wide-open spaces of the western landscape the film was shot in Alberta , Canada , the presence of vicious outlaws threatening the lives and welfare of the film 's heroes , much gunplay , conflicts with Indians , and the vulnerability of women in a lawless land . In this case , there is the added element of a little-known fact of western history , the presence of Asian immigrants and the not uncommon fate of many Chinese women sold into lives of prostitution . As some other reviewers have already noted here , the film runs a bit long . While it attempts to provide a history lesson in American diversity and prejudice , the script tends to shy away from providing much depth . It 's treatment of some themes is glancing and at times predictable . And one could also argue that an important social problem is played more for entertainment value than thought-provoking illumination . While Duvall is unbeatable in this kind of role , with the wisdom of years , a salty edge , and a self-deprecating sense of humor , the performance of Tom Haden Church helps hold the film together from start to finish . Skeptical , a bit soured by his bachelor cowboy life , and rarely smiling , he remains a wonderful foil to the older Duvall . And he gets the best line of the movie . When a madam objects to his rescue of the five Chinese girls by shouting , `` Those girls are my property , `` he replies , `` That 's the price of capitalism . `` The set designer for `` Deadwood '' has created a wild , woolly frontier town , and we 're reminded in scene after scene that the West was unpaved . There is mud to be found almost everywhere there are people , cattle , and horses . A making-of featurette has informative interviews with many of those both in front of and behind the cameras . Not a really great film , but worth watching whether you like westerns or not .",m,1
"I LOVE this movie . It is probably one of the best cowboy movies made in the last 10 years and is based on a true story which is even better in my opinion . The only problem with this movie is that since it was a mini series the movie `` ends '' halfway and the credits roll . If I had never seen it I might have thought it just ended badly and never seen the end . Why did n't they take out the credits and just recorded it as one movie as is done with so many mini-series put in DVD ? Never the less , I highly recommend this movie ! ! !",f,1
"The scenery makes it worth the upgrade to Blu-ray . Add that to a great plot , great cinematography , and award-winning acting , you get a movie that you might put in your personal 'top ten ' list . Yep , it 's that good .",m,1
This movie was like old time hollywood . Then they had class . Today mostly junk . I loved this movie . Robert Duvall and all were marvelous and as I watched this movie I was entranced . Why did this not win an award ? Stupid hollywood . I hope more quality movies TV or other will be made . But I doubt it . Hooray for Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church .,f,1
"BROKEN TRAIL is a film that is similar to RED RIVER , one of the great classics of American cinema , which stars John Wayne and Montgomery Clift . Both of the films concern drives of livestock across hundreds of miles in the American west . In BROKEN TRAIL , the livestock are horses , and the trip is from Oregon to Wyoming , while in RED RIVER , the livestock are cattle , and the trip is from Texas to Kansas . Having watched RED RIVER a few times , I was expecting some sort of tension or schism to occur among the cowboys in BROKEN TRAIL , but this never materialized in BROKEN TRAIL . Perhaps , this sort of expectation made me more involved with or interested in BROKEN TRAIL . BROKEN TRAIL requires watching two DVD discs , each about 90 minutes long . Here are the positive features of BROKEN TRAIL . I was not able to detect any shortcomings : 1 The cinematography is a wonder to behold , treating the viewer to beautiful landscapes of river and distant mountain crags Canadian Rockies near Calgary . I was under the impression that Ansel Adams was hired as a photography consultant for this film . Great photography does not occur by accident . Wisdom in the framing , lighting , and so on , is evident in all of the landscape scenes . 2 This movie is configured for horse-lovers . There are endless scenes of cowboys riding on individual horses , and of the swarming herd of horses being driven through the wilderness . The horses come in various colors they are not all brown . The storyline does not give any personality to any particular horse . In contrast , for example , in GULLIVER 'S TRAVELS starring Ted Danson and Mary Steenbergen , the horses talk and express their opinions on the human social condition . 3 BROKEN TRAIL has a strong moral storyline , provided by the steadfast good-guy persona of each of the cowboys , and which contrasts with that of Big Rump Kate the madame and her cohort of killers . The good cowboys include Robert Duvall and Thomas Church . In fact , I bought this movie because I liked Thomas Church , in his portrayal of The Sandman in Spiderman-3 . To be brief , none of the cowboys shows any concupiscent inclinations towards the fugitive Chinese ladies . Another moral aspect of the cowboys , is that they take care of an older Chinese man , for example , by using a simple surgical technique to stitch up a wound on his head , and afterwards smearing the repaired wound with grease , in order to prevent infestation by flies and bacteria . 4 The storyline of BROKEN TRAIL consists of the adventures encountered while driving the herd of horses eastwards for hundreds of miles . At one point , they encounter a group of five young Chinese women who are being transported for `` employment '' by the madame , Big Rump Kate . The cowboys rescue the the Chinese ladies , and bring them along with them as fugitives , preventing them from being claimed as property by the bad madame . An undercurrent of tension is provided through much of the film , because the viewer knows that the henchmen of the bad madame are tracking the cowboys , in order to capture the Chinese ladies . Near the end , there is some comedy relief , when the cowboys are approached by fierce Indians demanding two horses as a price to pass through their land . Towards the very end of the film , the henchmen catch up . But do n't worry , I do not tell what happens next . 5 The movie is suitable for children from the age 12 and up . There are a few gunfights , and a few wounds . But there are no flying body parts , no curse words , and no exposed topless women . 6 For your interest , here is a bio of the actress playing the oldest of the young Chinese ladies : Gwendoline Yeo was born in Singapore . She moved to California as a teenager , graduating with honors from St . Ignatius College Preparatory in 1994 . Yeo received her BA from UCLA before the age of 20 , graduating summa cum laude , as well as receiving a diploma piano from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music . She specialized in playing the Chinese instrument , guzheng , and she had a radio show on NPR-KCRW . Ms . Yeo was crowned Miss Asian America in 1995 and named Miss Chinatown USA in 1998-1999 . Okay , okay , now we know what happens to over-achievers . They become movie stars . 7 For your interest , here is a bio of Thomas Church : Mr . Church was born in Yolo , California , to an Army health care worker father and a telephone company sales rep mother . He was raised in Laredo , Texas , and graduated from high school in Harlingen , Texas , in 1979 , going on to attend the University of North Texas . Church was a radio personality . A part in an independent film convinced him to move to California to pursue acting . He played the role of airport mechanic Lowell Mather for six seasons on the NBC show Wings . He worked in television for two seasons . He had supporting roles in films such as Tombstone , George of the Jungle , and The Specials .",m,1
"Honestly , Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make this a four-star movie . It 's a classic western story , with clearly defined good guys and bad guys . The character interaction is top-notch . There 's no multi-million dollar special effects , but the acting by all is rock solid . Print Ritter Duvall and Tom Harte Tomas Haden Church unexpectedly become the guardians of five abused and abandoned Chinese girls in the midst of their horse drive .",m,1
"FINALLY ! ! ! I love American Westerns . I love US History , Native Americans , horses and adventures . I grew up thinking `` Why ca n't Chinese people have significant leading roles in the Westerns ? `` Were we not a part of the American history ? ? ? Railroad anyone ? California Gold Rush ? This is better than my wildest dreams ! 5 Chinese girls in leading , respectable , roles in a Western ! ! ! I am so happy ! Thomas Haden Church is so hot because of this role ! Everyone ! ! ! Go watch it !",f,1
"Both Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church excel and head a marvelous cast in this gripping western that is filled with amazingly beautiful images of the American Northwest . About 3 hours long , but it seems much less . I wanted it to go on and on . Two men with a plan for the future discover just how many curves fate can throw in their direction , and they adapt wonderfully . This is a western that your wife will enjoy as well as yourself ; sometimes the heartstrings are being pulled as well as the triggers . The images on Blu-Ray are outstanding .",m,1
This is one of the most beautifully filmed and moving stories of all time . Blu-ray only makes it even more beautiful to behold . Both Duvall and Church are superb in their portrayals of cowboys with hearts . This BD belongs in every man 's library .,m,1
"The film opens in Chinatown San Francisco , 1898 where we five exotic virgins from the Celestial Empire are bought by Captain Billy Fender James Russo to be sold as slaves and introduced into the brief and violent life of prostitution . . . Robert Duvall stars as `` Print '' Ritter , an old cowhand whose sister left a will inheriting all to him rather than to her own son , Tom Harte Thomas Haden Church who lives in John Day Country Oregon . . . Print ignores why she has done it , or why was crossed between the two , but his sister done it . . . Print got the idea to buy a team of tough , high-desert mustangs -- three to eight years of age -- to take them to Sheridan , Wyoming to sell to the British Empire ; the money they 'll earn will be to increase their capital . . . And on the shares , Print figures a 25-75 split on profits after expenses and loan repayment to the bank . . . From this point , Hill 's Western becomes a road movie , with all kinds of odd characters , from ugly villains to a friendly musician , but the key to `` Broken Trail '' is that through a series of circumstances , fate has placed the five Chinese innocent girls in the hands of Tom and his uncle . . . But the reality is another . . . Their families sold them to that rat captain heading out to the mining camp , where Kate , an odious saloon owner , bought them from an associate in San Francisco . . . Our two cowboys save the girls ' lives from rape and take them along on their journey . . . With great photography , gorgeous vistas , perilous ground , sensible brave girls , good and decidedly courageous men , great action when it is necessary , and a big confrontation at the climax of the movie , Hill 's Western is a must see film for the fans of the genre . . .",m,1
"I am a real western fan and I loved this movie . It is more family oriented than most and Robert Duval does a wonderful job as usual , acting as a `` good man '' when it comes to all these women he seemingly inherits . He does the right thing , all the way through . Recommended ! !",f,1
This movie is terrific . A stark look into the old west and how the bad people treated the less fortunate and the good people who had higher moral values . Great job by Robert Duvall and Tom Church .,f,1
"I love westerns , and this one ranks as one of the greatest of all times . Much superior to the over-rated Lonesome Dove . If I could give this 10 stars , I would ! !",m,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed watching `Broken Trail ' and after viewing westerns for over five decades I would now rank this movie as my favourite . It is superb in all respects . The landscapes are spectacular , the acting brilliant , the action at times breathtaking and a storyline that readily elicits , in the viewer , a full range of emotions . The Blu-ray version does great justice to the movie . The colour , the sound and the sharpness of each frame make this movie a true high definition experience . The credits at the end of the movie indicated that the story was based on true events and this surprise , without forewarning , acted like the icing on an already delicious slice of cake . It 's a movie that I will watch over and over again .",m,1
"I have written before on many westerns . And I have written before on one of the entries in Robert Duvall & iexcl ; ¯s Trilogy Open Range . His Trilogy includes Lonesome Dove , Broken Trail and Open Range . I return with a review of a second movie from that Trilogy : Broken Trail . This is a superb movie . 1 . It is a story of ugliness the sale of five teen age Chinese girls to a madam at a mining camp in Idaho . 2 . It is a picture of the incredible natural beauty a herd of many horses on the range in the Canadian Rockies ¨C simulating the mountains in Oregon , Idaho and Montana . 3 . It is the story of Print Ritter Robert Duvall and his nephew Tom Harte Thomas Haden Church ©¤ planning to move500 horses to Montana for sale to an agent of the British Government . 4 . More ugliness emerges as the & iexcl ; °slaver & iexcl ; ± , who has been hired to move these girls , runs into Ritter , Harte and the horses . They agree to join up , but this & iexcl ; °slaver & iexcl ; ± secretly dopes some wine he has brought along . He steals there money and one of the girls and takes off , and soon rapes this child . . Ultimately Ritter and Harte wake up , and Harte decides to pursue this & iexcl ; °slaver . & iexcl ; ± When he catches up , he gets the jump on him and soon hangs him . A bit later , this girl essentially commits suicide by falling out of their wagon into the path of several rapidly moving horses . Even later another girl comes down with a fever and soon passes away too . 5 . Still more ugliness emerges as they head north . Ritter seeks a town , with some & iexcl ; °civil authority & iexcl ; ± , where he can turn in the girls . The town he picks turns out to be the worst one possible , as it is the site of the mining camp and the home of the madam & iexcl ; °Big Rump Kate . & iexcl ; ± Harte and another member of their group barely escape , but pick up two other victims : a large middle aged Chinaman , Lung Hay Donald Fong and a small , and still pretty women in her thirties , Mrs Nola Johns Greta Scacchi , who had been forced into prostitution when her husband died . 6 . It is a picture of the incredible human beauty as Harte ultimately falls in love with the oldest Chinese gal , Sun Foy Gwendoline Yeo and Nola with Print Ritter . He is very fond of Nola , but sees himself as too old , but when they both are & iexcl ; °gone & iexcl ; ± they are buried side by side . 7 . There is still more ugliness in this movie near the end , but Ritter and Harte survive , and their horse venture turns out to be a huge success . However , it is far better to see the remaining three Chinese ladies , make that two©¤as Yeo backs away from a trip to San Francisco , confident that something permanent will work out with Harte©¤head west on the stagecoach , all dressed up as young ladies should be , along with Nola and Lung Hay .",m,1
"Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make an excellent combination in this Old West seting . Great story line with excellent acting . If you like westerns , you will love this .",m,1
I never get tried of watching Robert Duvall movies . His sense of fairness and compassion comes across in every part he plays . Thomas Haden Chruch 's performance in this movie made me like him a little more .,f,1
"I have been buying from Amazon now for 2 years and they have never been late on a promised delivery time . Now that I am buying Blu-Ray DVDs , Amazon is the only way to go . If you buy 3 , you can save enough on one movie to pay to for shipping , so you get 3 for the price of 2 at Wal-Mart or Best Buy . Also , you ca n't find this title locally . This is a under-rated gem of a film . Reference quality transfer with just a few specks . 9 out of a 10 . Very good picture quality , even in the low light and night shots . Excellent story and character development . Audio does n't use the rear surround speakers much though , about the only knock against this film . Audio on the front is very good with dialog always easy to hear . This is a definite buy on Blu-Ray if you like westerns .",m,1
"Great Western , highly recommend . Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church both did a great job with this movie . It had a nice switch with it dealing with them driving horses and come across 5 Chinese girls that they save from being sold into prostitution and many adventures along the journey .",m,1
"After all the westerns ever made , you 'd think that they 'd run out of good ideas after a while . But `` Broken Trail '' proves that there is still life , and fresh blood , to be seen in THE American film genre . The three-hour film finds an uncle and nephew running a herd of horses to Wyoming , and unexpectedly become guardians of five Oriental women meant to become prostitutes . The journey that they all take together is a truly fascinating one , which has never been covered in this genre before . While the storytelling and cinematography are great , the two highlights are the casting and the music . Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church are fantastic as the two male leads , and well-deserved the Emmys they won for their roles . The strong supporting cast , of which there are too many to name here , do fantastic as well . The score by David Mansfield and Van Dyke Parks is truly memorable , and adds to the strengths of this epic piece . As a fan of the western , I truly enjoyed `` Broken Trail . `` If you enjoy this genre , and the acting talents of Duvall and Haden Church , then you 'll enjoy it as well . Movie DVD Grade : A",m,1
This is a great move . It is an honest rendention of life during this time frame . The charactors are not heros but down to earth people doing what they know is right and just . I highly recommend this move for all family members to watch together .,m,1
"A really enjoyable movie in the same vein as Lonesome Dove , great outdors effects and stunning scenery , the acting is first class , excellent story line , very authentic attention to detail , and to cap it all off an outstanding performance from Robert Duval and all the actors in the movie . All the ingrients of a first class western , certainly gets my vote .",m,1
"Robert Duvall can gallop into a western without much in the way of preparation , such is his natural affinity for the genre . Not surprisingly , he delivers yet another convincing and satisfying performance as the uncle who inherits his sister 's estate and then strikes a deal with his nephew to set things right . It 's not the typical conflict of western epics , but good enough to set the story in motion and bring it to an odd but worthy conclusion . Thomas Haden Church as the rejected son is the real surprise in Broken Trail . While his character is low key , the honesty and humor Church delivers is far from it . In every scene he persuasively portrays a man who responds to his situation with quiet strength and pragmatic acceptance of the outcome . Beyond stellar performances , the film offers great production which includes beautiful scenery and attention to detail . There are moments when the story seems to noticably slow down , but this strikes me as purposeful . The scenes in between story movement are what give it depth , and contrast the ugliness of human subjugation with the gorgeous landscape in which it takes place . This is a rare film that stands up to many repeated viewings without ever becoming stale .",m,1
"I have n't seen this DVD , but I saw the mini-series when it was broadcast and agree with all the positive comments -- including that it is better than the more famous Lonesome Dove . One thing I have n't seen mentioned here is that it gets my vote in Movie FanFare 's recent `` What 's the all-time best movie shootout ? `` poll . I hit rewind on my DVR about four times just for the pleasure of watching the shootout sequence over again -- by itself that sequence elevates this to Western Classic status . Splendidly done !",f,1
"I love Robert Duvall , and believe that the only actor who does cowboys better is John Wayne - but that is probably generational . This is a two bags of popcorn movie .",m,1
"Just finished watching this superb movie last night , and like a kid , I 'm tempted to watch it again ! But I 'll wait- so that I can enjoy it more , since I 'm not a kid ! This is a great adventure in the `` real '' , earthy , tough , no-holds-barred , sometimes bloody way , not unlike `` The Culpepper Cattle Co . `` , another great fairly recent depiction of the Wild West . In my opinion , this is far more enjoyable than movies like `` Unforgiven '' and `` The Wild Bunch '' for it 's story . The story is touching , exciting , suspenseful , and sometimes humourous- in other words , everything you would expect from a great movie ! And , it certainly helps to have fine acting , great cinematography , sound , and amazingly beautiful scenery . I 'll not try to tell the story- I 'm sure other reviewers have . But I think you 'll enjoy this movie even more if you stop reading reviews all the way that attempt to describe the entire movie from start to finish , even giving away the ending ! Why the hell do people do that , anyway ? ! Anyway , for a special treat , if you 're in to the occasional `` marathon '' type movie night , try watching this back to back with `` The Culpepper Cattle Co . `` Either way , enjoy !",m,1

"Just as art is eye-catching , and models are the objects of art , `` Bellissima '' captures beauty in multiple ways . The story is incredible , the music is very fitting , and the film as a whole is exceptional cinematography . The film is about a mother that wants her daughter to excel as a model . The mother 's life revolves around the success of her daughter . The daughter , however , is not entirely thrilled with the idea and her mother 's determination . Several events come full circle , leaving one with a sense of irony about their lives and the twists of fate . `` Bellissima '' is a quick watch , and never boring You are bound to feel sympathetic for the daughter as her life takes several unexpected turns . `` Bellissima '' is emotional at times and perfect for those who enjoy dramatic films .",m,1
"A humble and discretely poor woman , starred by my beloved Italian Actress in any age : Anna Magnani , will make the best she can for her daughter wins in this attractive competition .

"I had a lot of high hopes going into the theater for this movie . It exceeded those hopes in a glorious fashion . I loved the original , the sotry , the art , everything . So when I heard that Bloodlust was being played real close to my work I went to see it . Amazing . I am a true believer that the original is always the best , but this blew the original right out of the water . The art form , the story which was great because , I was wondering where the bloodlust was coming from , and when that was revealed the true nature of the story came in . < p > Excellent anime . I will definitely be seeing again in the next couple of days . And , when I hear that it will be coming to DVD I will have my pre-order set .",m,1
"Ok I just have to say this . My and my friend , we watched this movie with the sound off . And you know what ? It was still very enjoyable . This movie is all about the art . The story is merely an excuse to have a dark , very badass anti-hero walk around acting like a badass in a visually interesting and pleasing environment . I did n't know until after I rented this movie that it only comes dubbed in English , and it really threw me off . I HATE dudding . . . which is why I had the sound off . The dubbing on this is about as good as can be expected , although of lesser quality than Princess MOnonoke or Akira . The dialogue is terrible and a bit confusing at times , and the plot . . . well the plot is basic and not terribly important . Rent this movie if you want to look at something pretty and nicely animated .",m,0
"From the moment I saw buff guys with big weapons riding around in a modified tank , I knew this would be different from the original . The entire world seems to work on different principles less gritty magic , more gritty machines , and it comes across quite clearly in this radically different anime style . Fans of the & quot ; X & quot ; feature will enjoy it , but others will wonder why so many heads look like triangles with *gasp* huge eyes . < p > But the thing that got me to watch the original was interesting violence , and you 've got some here . Unicycle-riding midgets , werewolves with giant fangs in their abdomen , terminally ill patients shooting up to turn into psychic juggernauts , and the voice of Starscream ! Some of this does seem like the product of a bad drug trip , but it is well-rendered and imaginative . < p > The parasitic & quot ; but I 've always been a good parasite , & quot ; hand returns with a bit of sarcastic wit this time , providing the much-needed dialogue and exposition D is incapable of delivering . Still , D seems a bit loose-tongued in comparison to his last appearance in 1985 . His voice is well casted as a matter of opinion , most of these voices are great , but there are times when I sat up in the theatre puzzled , because D just would n't say this or that . Still , he delivers the righteous justice and unrelenting effort of any good , sword-wielding anime protagonist . < p > The protagonist complex of so many characters is interesting , because many come across as genuinely good main characters , almost competing for screen time . Some stories are intense enough to push D off altogether , but not for too long . He is never five minutes away from a fight scene . However , the antagonist complex of so many characters everybody seems to hate everybody that they are n't sleeping with or being paid millions to save gets a little thin . Carmilla , who could be considered the principle villainess , does n't even get mentioned in the first sixty minutes of the movie . < p > All in all , there are compelling , intertwining motivations , and enough eye candy to keep the average fan of anime through a sitting , but the ending is cliche are n't all the best ones ? , and other than to catch a few fight scenes over again , I did n't see much rewatch value . But if you can , see this in the theatre . Some of the visuals , and all of the sounds , deserve it .",m,1
"The original D was a tour de force , such an original take on vampire hunters that anyone who saw the movie remembered it decades later . Now D is back and even tougher than before . The animation is simply amazing . The crumbling crosses in the beginning really set the mood of evil and terror . What starts out as a kidnapping turns out to be oh so much more . The plot develops smoothly , giving little away beforehand . Soon you 'll find yourself conflicted , then cheering for the vampire that D is hunting . The end is another totally new twist that M . Night could learn a thing or two from . The villains , merging of vampire magic and technology , and D - all combine for another fantastic to this Dystopian far future where vampires rule the night , and D brings justice with a sword . And this face thing in his palm .",m,1
"It 's an awesome movie . If you like anime , or just animation in general you 'll enjoy this movie . Its an awesome movie and an instant cult classic .",m,1
"Based on the third novel of Hideyuki Kikuchi 's popular series , this film evokes the milieu of its source material with greater accuracy than Toyoo Ashida 's 1985 adaptation of the first novel . Herein , the titular character is commissioned by an affluent family to eliminate a powerful vampire , and to return a young woman who he 's kidnapped . D 's activities are complicated by a society of monsters hired by his prey for protection and a group of bounty hunters with whom he 's competing for the same objective . I never had an opportunity to see this in the theater upon its initial release . I assumed that the result would be an adaptation of Kikuchi 's work colored by the rapid , severe action sequences and brisk pace typical of other Kawajiri features like Wicked City and Ninja Scroll . My guess was accurate only in regard to the former element ; while the violence of this movie is as stylized and impressive in its execution as that of Kawajiri 's other directorial efforts , this is surely as measured as it was in print , a story that develops slowly and for good reason . The visuals of this film can not be faulted . CGI is implemented seamlessly with cel animation to great effect . But the finest accomplishments of this movie 's production are an array of magnificent backgrounds that depict vivid pastoral settings of numerous environments and extraordinary , sprawling interiors in which Gothic and Victorian design are rendered with impossibly ornate detail . I 've seen a lot of animated features , and this is probably the most beautiful among them . Character designer Yutaka Minowa must be credited for his efforts : while his D is quite similar in appearance to the magnificent illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano found in the novels , the other characters are not dissimilar to those seen in other Kawajiri films . In particular , Borgoff Marcus bears more than a passing resemblance to Himuro Gemma of Ninja Scroll . The elaborateness of the characters almost equals that of their surroundings . Bloodlust is unique among anime in that its original language track was English the Japanese-language track was actually recorded third , after a Cantonese-language version ! . The quality of the vocal performances are very mixed . Andrew Philpot 's D is comparable to Kaneto Shiozawa 's voicing of the 1985 film : subdued , with an undercurrent of intensity . It 's praiseworthy , though it really does n't compare to the authoritative baritone that Michael McConnohie used to reinforce D 's commanding presence in the first movie . Michael McShane provides the sentient parasite of D 's left hand with a nervous swagger that compliments the character 's comic relief . Most of the other voice actors are certainly competent . In fact , John Rafter Lee voices Meier Link with an imperial menace that 's subtly impressive . But much of the dialogue sounds rushed and clumsy , which may have more to do with the difficulties common to English translations than the failings of the performers . It 's often difficult to translate , paraphrase and speak an English phrase properly in the same amount of time as a Japanese equivalent , something that longtime viewers of English-dubbed anime or jidaigeki are well aware of . Put simply : for common speech , English is usually the more verbose and Japanese the more efficient of the two languages . While Bloodlust is surely as attractive and exciting as could be expected , it is n't as fun as I expected it to be . The moral ambiguity of the film is refreshing . There is only one protagonist and one antagonist , and the integrity of the other characters is not easily delineated . The film 's conclusion is aptly sober , and surely not to all tastes . Technically , this feature is as fine a technical accomplishment as any that Kawajiri 's produced and as downcast as many of his other movies . While I came away from this satisfied , it 's ultimately one of the more depressing fantasies that I 've seen in a while . As DVDs come , this one is just fine . Its picture is rendered with excellent clarity , thankfully presented in 1 . 85:1 . I 'm not a videophile , so I ca n't reliably comment on the peculiar merits of this disc 's imaging , but it looks great to me . However , the sound mix is definitely lacking . Dialogue is sometimes almost rendered inaudible by the louder score and excellent sound effects , something that often frustrates me about Dolby 5 . 1 mixes . Menus and introduction alike are as attractive as the film requires . An included featurette is better than most in that it 's watchable ; its most interesting portions consist of commentary on the film 's story and production by Kawajiri and Minowa . Another feature compares rough storyboards to their corresponding finished scenes , which is of mild interest . Least among the extra materials is a `` Top Ten '' compilation of favorite scenes resulting from an online vote ; if you did n't participate in this exercise years ago , I ca n't imagine that this would interest you . Several of the film 's trailers and TV spots are also included . Most efficacious of this lot is Bloodlust 's slickly edited Korean theatrical trailer , which oddly features English narration accompanied by Hangul subtitles ! Trailers for other Urban Vision releases can also be perused ; those who 've seen the Golgo 13 and Wicked City trailers on Streamline Pictures ' VHS releases will note that Urban Vision acquired the defunct company 's advertisement content in supplement to its features !",m,1
"D is back and is already on is way to [ stardom ] . If you have saw the first series you will love this film , it has all that makes an anime brilliant . Re vamped animation and fight scenes that will make you 're pet monkey crall to the corner of the room . < p > In other words this is a must see anime .",m,1
"To sum the movie up in two words : Nothing Better ! The animation is spectacular , the storyline not hard to understand , and the characters are just perfect . For those of you who want a movie that will fill that empty spot for action buy it now , you wo n't regret it .",m,1
A nice sequel for an all time classic anime . Brilliant animation with a great storyline make this an awesome anime altogether . All anime fans owe it to themselves to get this now .,m,1
"This has to be the best anime and best vampire movie I have ever seen . PERIOD ! ! First off , the animation is just out of this world , it is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I 've seen except maybe Ghost in the Shell . It was just so crisp and clean . Second , I have never seen a movie where the music just fit so perfectly . I literally had goose bumps at some parts . Third , the story is great . Now like others have said it does have a few parts that you sorta have to quess on what 's happened or how it 's happening but it 's nothing too major . Fouth , The characters are just great and have real personaltiys and their not just cookie cutter . Now on some of the other reviews people have said how they prefer the japanese voices and that they were dissapointed that they are n't in the movie . Well guys I hate to break it to you but there are n't any japanese voices . The voices for the characters were all done here in the states and the movie was never done in japanese that is why you ca n't have japanese dubbing . I personally do n't think the voices could have been done better , they just fit every chracter . So all of you that do n't own this movie go out and buy it right now ! ! ! ! !",m,1
"Before I go on about how great this movie is , let me just take a second to point out a few of the things less than perfect that appear in the film . OK , there English dubbing tend to get a bit annoying at times the female bounty hunter mainly and since this was actually produced in the US , there 's no Japanese dubbing at all . That female bounty hunter that I just mention was often painful to watch and her reason for becoming a hunter was just a total cliche . That , coupled with D , a cool character maybe a bit too much of the stereotypical loner protagonist , almost made parts of the film almost comical . That said , the movie as a whole was just awesome . A pretty damn innovative story although one of the bad guys was obviously `` borrowed '' from Ninja Scroll '' with some of the most beautiful animation seen anywhere . It really was a thrill ride that seemed to be both cutting edge and reminscent of some of the cool , early mid 80s anime . Really cool stuff . If you dug the first D movie , Ninja Scroll , Mononoke or any action oriented anime , or have yet to see any Japanese animation , pick this one up .",m,1
"This movie is one of the best animes I 've seen in a while . It has absolutely stunning visuals . The plot is a little complex , but not so much as to be confusing like many other japanese movies . The character development did leave a bit to be desired , but they did craft a plot with a few more subtleties than the first Vampire Hunter D movie . Voice acting is top notch and , for those of you who seem a little confused , the movie was only recorded with an english voice track . Much like parts of Blood : The Last Vampire Never heard why , but I do n't mind so long as it is well done .",m,1
"First off , this movie was created with english voice actors . This movie was not originally dubbed in japanese . When the movie was premiered in Japan , they watched with Japanese subtitles . Now after clarifying that , I 'd like to say that I was so impressed with this movie . I loved the original Vampire Hunter D movie and I felt this was a huge step up . Both movies are classics for there time . The first is not as impressive artistically yet can still be appreciated and even praised for being so much fun now . But Bloodlust blew me away with beautiful artwork , amazing landscapes , and very creative characters and monsters . The voice talent was also impressive and the storyline , yet thin was very gripping . I also felt that the way this movie was compiled , reminded me of Ninja Scroll . So if you were a fan of Ninja Scroll , give Bloodlust a shot , or vice versa . Enjoy .",f,1
I can only sum up this movie in one word . . . WOW,m,1
"Vampires , Futuristic weapons , love , war , Good , Evil . . . . This DVD has it ALL ! Storyline is excellent and original . Brings an interesting twist to the vampire legend ! A+++++++++ in my book !",m,1
"With D , the character of renowned anime status from the original Vampire Hunter D film , ans his symbiotic hand , this was an excellent experience in the theatre . The art is incredible , and the story unique , as well as having the gothic-tech feel of the original . This was , in my opinion as good or better than the original movie , I recommend it highly to all anime fans .",m,1
"I actually had to order this movie overseas from one of the Asian market stores so I could get a subbed audio version rather then this awful atrocious dubbed version we 're forced to hear . The animation is incredible and the overall story fits with the movie just like the first movie , but if you 're expecting more new age fight scenes like with Trinity Blood or Hellsing you 're going to be disappointed then . Again though I 'd advise trying to get the subbed version of this movie as the terrible acting and awful timing of the dialogue just makes you wince sadly this happens primarily with the main cast characters which really hurts the enjoyment value of the movie even more Comes as no surprise we have n't heard any of the actors actresses on anymore anime movies or series luckily .",m,0
A much improved story and the anime was far superior to it 's predecessor `` Vampire D '' . A very enjoyable feature and worth watching .,m,1
"If you are into anime and vampires than Bloodlust is a MUST HAVE . This is something you will want to watch over and over again . This is a movie you do n't want to end . *slight spoiler warning*Unlike in other vampire movies , this one has a twist . The vampire that steals the girl actually loves her . ****The action , the passion , the comedy . It is all there ; Bloodlust has the whole package . You will not be disapointed . If I had to criticise the movie it would be that there is no part two or that it is not twice as long . Seriously , this movie is that good . I 'll be buying another since I lost the last one I had .",m,1
"No one can deny that the animation in this movie is gorgeous , stunning , beautiful . Characters all have depth to their faces , fluidity to their movies , while still being realistic moving , which is hard to do in animation . While some disagree , the dubbing really is n't bad at all , it even borderlines on good , as do the actors chosen to lend their voices to the parts . However , I 'm not the first to say that the connection between Charlotte and Link was , well , silly at best . Charlotte comes off as being stupid and Link comes off as being an uptight psycho-possesive boyfriend . D was the best in this movie . People complain he did n't have enough depth , well , he 's gon na be around for a while . I doubt that he has any desire just to pop out and fall in love , become someone 's best friend , save a puppy , etc . He was stunningly animated . Maybe that 's just my love for D . Overall , if one could combine the beautiful animation of this one with the storyline of the original , it 'd be the classic anime , the touchstone for all anime to come . This is worth buying , I believe .",f,1
"Before going deep on this review something must be made clear as there are lots of reviews that are not being acurate on this point : Vampire hunter D : Bloodlust original soundtrack IS the english version . A joint-venture between a US company Urban Vision and japanese producers , all lips are synched to the english soundtrack that is available on this disc , even the japanese trailer has subtitles , just like the theatrical run did on Japan . Later they made a japanese audio track , but as that is a DUB , I really do n't care for it shame on you if your reasoning for the whole dub sub argument went down with this one . < p > The first Vampire Hunter D animation , an OVA released on 1985 in Japan and later in the US also available on DVD became an instant classic among fans , and years later it was still ranking high with fans , a cult second to Akira . < p > While not exactly a sequel and you ca n't really tell if this is AFTER or BEFORE the original OVA , this moviei s another story on D 's life , a hunt after another vampire . But this is just the excuse to explore two aspects of the vampires : the forbidden love between a vampire and a human , and the question on how eternal life would affect you something dealt on the first one . < p > Animation is just great , blending computer graphics and traditional animation to create a dark and richly detailed world . Sound effectsare on their right place and the musical score is great , adding depth to the characters and the situation they face . As any anamorphic DVD , video is just great althought it is a bit grainy , more to give more of a film look , as details are really sharp on this one . < p > Bloodlust may not be an anime for everyone , as it is got more depth than the average releases out there , but it is an easy to follow and entertaining movie , an instant classic just as it 's predecessor .",m,1
"This is the best follow-up I 've ever seen ! As a sequel it stands alone . On it 's own it can hold without the previous movie . Originally I was under the impression this was set before the last movie . After seeing I understand how people can get the misconception . The imagery is exquisite and the characters are real . You have to appreciate the way anime does n't WASTE time with cheap songs to sell their art . . . I 'm not jaded because of anime , it 's the facts ! If you love animation done right you 'd never watch another Disney cartoon again . This might make you change your mind like I did , long ago .",m,1
"I just saw the movie today in Austin . I am here to tell you this : I waited two years to see this movie pathtic no ? and it was worth the wait . Everything meshed well together . My only complaint is unlike most reviewers it could have been longer . Espeaiclly when Carmila gets in to the story . That went a too qucikly , but utterwise go see this movie .",m,1
OK NOW I'AM ONLY 13 BUT THIS MOVIE KINKS SO MUCH A** THAT YOU WILL CREAM YOUR PANTS . NOW I KNOW THAT IT IS AN ANIME BUT IT KICKS SO MUCH IT 'S MORE OR LESS A 2 ONE THE FIRST ONE WAS OK IT WAS NOT THE BEST BUT FOR IT 'S TIME I GIVE IT PROPS . BUT IN THIS ONE THE VAMPS TRY TO KILL THE VAMP HUNTER . PLUS THERE IS A LITTLE BACK SIDE OF A WOMEN SHOWING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY ALRIGHT . SO IN ALL ONISTY I RECOMAND THIS DVD IF YOU LIKE VAMP MOVIES .,m,1
"What 's hot : -It 's a bloody mess-It has some serious . . . < p > What 's not : -Some of the characters are just plain stupid yes , you Leila -A couple of ironic twists < p > What 's strange : -Why do n't they put some . . . in this instead of extreme emotional love . < p > What 's the final word : This is among the bloodiest movies on Earth . Once you watch it , it may make you throw up .",m,1
"This movie flat out rocks . Tons of evil characters and heroes that have their own unique special abilities . Almost identical to ninja scroll , but in the Vampire Hunter D universe . Buckets of blood to go along with stunning animation . . . This is what anime was made to do !",m,1
"I loved the first `` Vampire Hunter D . `` I 'm not a fan of the anime genre , but that movie stood as a good movie on its own merits . The hero was noble . The damsel was capable of kicking some mutant tush . And the villain was undeniably EVIL . < p > Most of what I loved about the first movie is missing from this one . D does n't seem as noble a character as he did before though some virtue does shine through . The damsel here is a lovesick puppy who is smitten with the vampire who kidnapped her . And we do n't really even know who the real villain is until the end of the movie . Granted , this last point can make for a good plot , but there was n't enough forshadowing to really make this work . The villain is n't even mentioned until within the last half-hour of the film . < p > The new voice that they got for his hand was a HORRIBLE CHOICE , by the way . < p > The good points of the movie include the awesome musical score and the animation , which is mixed with good computer animation that almost makes some backgrounds look real . I have heard that this movie was actually made in the U . S . , making a literal subtitle translation unnecessary . < p > In short , this is a okay movie , but the original is MUCH better .",m,0
THIS THE BEST OF THE BEST IN ANIME,m,1
"Wow ! This sequel to Vampire Hunter D took 15 years to arrive though I did n't mind that much because I did n't see the original until a year before Bloodlust came out . Was the long wait worth it ? You bet ! You will be able to tell that the animation is a bit different but it does n't take away from the overall movie . While not quite as dark as it 's predecessor , Bloodlust has some creepy moments and is probably more of an action flick which is not a bad thing . As with the first , this sequel is not a typical vampire film and is sure to please fans of the original and even new comers to anime . As for the DVD , the special features are somewhat plentiful . Very nice picture quality but as for the sound quality . . . Ugh ! The sound between the dialouge and the music during the film are so unbalanced that you will find yourself having to turn the volume very high to understand everything being said and other times you will have to turn the volume lower due to a sudden burst of music right after a character 's spoken dialogue . While watching this movie , I suggest you keep the remote in your hand for volume adjustment . Other than the sound problem , Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is certainly worthy to be seen more than once as is the original .",m,1
"As the title of this review states `Good Story ' and that 's exactly what this movie represents , story telling and nothing more . The fighting scenes are very dramatic but far too short they only last mere seconds . Do n't purchase this movie if you are really into animation for the action I am and this movie almost has no action at ALL ! . Again I will like to stress that the fighting scenes are too dramatic , the movie does not give you an opportunity to get into the action . You will see two people about to battle and just when you sit up to take in the full effect of what 's about to take place one person just dies ! ! Just like that ! ! The movie was good but I bought this movie because I thought it would have been action packed so I am very disappointed .",m,0
"I have no review of the version because I could n't get past the fact that there is no Japanese audio . With all the things that can be done with DVDs today , it does n't make any since that this one comes with 1 audio choice . Even for region 1 there is n't even a French audio selection . This seems like a shoddy product . A friend of mine even returned his copy because there is no Japanese selection .",m,0
"Ok , I saw this movie when it was out in theatres and it was amazing ! Unfortunately for me , it was english dubbed which I hate so when the dvd finally was released I bought it , especially for the fact that I would be able to watch it in its original japanese language format ! However , to my disappointment , IT HAS NONE ON THE DVD ! They acctually released the dvd , with only the dubbed version in it ! ! The special features also are terrible . . . this & quot ; fan 's favorite scenes & quot ; feature is completely useless and even dumb . < p > Therefore , for the anime itself , I would give it 5 stars , its a great movie , but if you 're like me and hate english dubbed versions and expect more from your dvds , I give this dvd a mere 2 stars and suggest that you rent it or borrow it from someone else or if you can , find a japanese dvd with subtitles with your region encoding .",m,0
"I can not say why . It is , after all , animated . There are few animated full-length films on my best-100 list . Nevertheless , Vampire Hunter D is on my of-all-movies , top-10 list . < p > I am not knowledgeable enough to rate the animation . Maybe the most important thing is it is not evident after the first few viewing minutes ; the movie just becomes an engrossing story . Animation only comes to mind afterwards ; when something is obviously better done through animation than special effects somewhat as black and white goes away after a few minutes of Young Frankenstein or Casablanca and comes to mind only when you think back on the film and realize color would not have been an asset . < p > Bloodlust has fabulous characters and a story complex enough and good enough to draw you in completely . It is much better than the first film .",m,1
"I 'm only a casual fan of anime . Almost every anime movie I 've seen shares the same annoying cliches : minimal character development , long sequences of self-righteous expository dialogue , the old freeze-frame-over-a-moving-background image during the fight scenes , etcetera . This movie has those same flaws , but it also has a great deal to recommend it . < p > The story itself involves D , a stoic half-vampire who hunts other vampires stop me if you 've heard this before in a post-apocalypse future . Except that this guy has a talking parasite in his hand that acts as his partner foil , and in the future depicted here , vampires are a dying breed . During the opening scene , a human woman is abducted by the great vampire Meier , and her family hires D to find her . < p > This is where the movie gets unique . D 's pretty much a cold fish , but the supposed bad-guy Meier is actually in love with the human woman , and his love is reciprocated . The only villanous quality I can see in the guy is that he 's a vampire . He leads D and a group of rival hunters on a long and picaresque chase through a bleak future , which is half gothic ruin and half dead urban sprawl . D 's travels are just as often depicted around decaying radio telescopes and highway overpasses as they are in cathedrals and forests . More of D 's past which is n't a whole lot is revealed along the way , and his interactions with Leila , one of the rival hunters , help flesh out her character well . < p > Leila may be the closest thing this movie has to a moral center . After all , Meier 's love for his human consort is believable , and it 's hard to peg him as a villian , while D comes across as blindly obsessive . This really is n't a good-and-evil thing , and the moral ambiguity adds a great deal to the story . Leila has the usual reasons for being a vampire hunter , but it 's her moral struggle toward the end that gives her character real depth . Luckily , she and D do n't fall into a romance which would have been predictable but all wrong , but they do develop a sort of friendship , which makes the ending sequence more poignant . Yes , this is an anime movie with a coherent ending . < p > There are fight scenes-lots of 'em , and they 're pretty bloody , but they 're well-choreographed , and the animation is great . The backgrounds are unique , and for the most part , the character drawings are masterfully done . The DVD does a great job of keeping everything clear and well-contrasted-not an easy thing in a movie with this much brown in its pallette . < p > All in all , it 's not the most original movie I 've seen , nor is it the most original anime , but this is a good , solid film that rewards repeated viewings .",m,1
"This is one of the best looking animes I have ever seen . It 's a great improvement from the first movie and it has some cool digital effects . I 'm no spoiler so I 'll keep it simple . Vampire Hunter D : Bloodlust is the sequel to the 1985 cult-classic anime . With more modern techniques in animation , VHD : B is a movie everyone has to see and experience with their own eyes . The monsters are sinister and the fight scenes are action-packed . The DVD has great special features including trailers and a behind the scenes feature . It 's a great buy . . . . so why not buy it ?",m,1
"D returns in this action packed follow up to the original . One thing you will immediately notice , is the clean animation . There is a great mix of C . G . and hand drawn cells . The story of D and his life is a sad one . Wandering through time seeing those around him die and fade away , as he remains unchanged and fighting for those that hire him . Just the thought of D lets you know he has an extensive past with many dark adventures . < p > Leila , a young bounty hunter , is after the same thing D is after - a young girl stolen by a vampire . Little do they know the problems that this girl causes . There is true love blossoming between the girl and the vampire , and that is among the most interesting turns of the plot . She wants to stay with him . < p > Like I said , the action is awesome . One of my favorite 's is when one of Leila 's companion 's uses an arm bow , slinging hundreds of arrows up into the air , then fall from the sky in a rain . Totally cool . You can see how far animation has come since the original , not that the original looked bad , just a tad dated . Also it was welcoming to have widescreen , which the original is not . Also the action is a little more discernable . You can easily tell who gets killed , and why . In the first it was a bit shakey in that area . < p > Also , a much changed and more quirky . Funny stuff . Bloodlust is a great follow up to the original . Enjoy !",m,1
"Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust - is what an anime horror , action , adventure , vampire story should be . A twisted future , with swords and guns , ruins and rockets , vampires and things that go bump in the night . The setting is an Earth in the far future . The very far future , an Earth that is just starting to recover from the past , where vampires are starting to die out . The focus of the story is a vampire who has fallen in love with a human . Now they wish to escape from everything that hounds them - the changing Earth , the girl 's family , hunters . Great artwork , good character design , good flow to the story - everything you could want in a movie . Even a cool twist at the end . The English caste voices are supplied by such greats as Wendee Lee , Debi Derryberry , Dwight Schultz , Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Michael McShane . There seems to be no Japanese sound track . In fact , it seems there may never have been one . The disc has a few extras , such as a Behind-The-Scenes featurette , trailers and storyboard to feature comparison . But the treasure of the disc is the anime , so get it new or used . Great for anime lovers or vampire lovers .",m,1
Shares much in common story-wise with the original Vampire Hunter D while not being `` just another copy '' . More modern graphics style and voice SFX and a more involved plotline make this a movie worth seeing for `` D '' fans and non-fans alike . Good ending .,m,1
"My title says it all . If you liked the first movie , heck , even if you hated the first movie or have no idea what or who Vampire Hunter D is . . . you should buy this ! To watch the first movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece of a anime film . I recommend this to anyone and everyone . You ca n't get any better than this people . Really . Also , read the book Vampire Hunter D : Demon Deathchase . It 's what the movie is based off of . Ok , time for plot breakdown : Charlotte , a rich man 's daughter has been *abducted* So we think by a mighty vampire named Meyer . D is hired by the man to retrive his daughter dead or alive . while the man also hired a group of renegade hunters to search for her too . D and the group meet from time to time and there is a spark of softness between Leila and D I wo n't tell when Anyhow , I dont wan na spoil a SUPURB anime for ya by telling the WHOLE plot but I will say the ending is so sweet . *sigh* Unless I did n't already say this , BUY IT ! I promise you wo n't regret it . And if you DO its oviously because you never watched it , silly !",f,1
"The animation is beautiful in this film , so good in fact that I 'd recommend Bloodlust for that reason alone . After more than fifteen years since the original , Bloodlust was definately welcome . The one bad thing about it is the lack of action , and the little action that there is is abbreviated in some way . With exception of two scenes , there are no action sequences that go longer than three minutes . The film , though , is n't long and the story is good enough to carry it from action to action . Great for those of you who liked Hellsing or the original Vampire Hunter D .",m,1
"vampire hunter d-bloodlust is a wonderful movie . it 's got violence , true love , adventure , and an awesome mysterious main character . this movie will totally rock your world . it 's different than most anime ; there 's no cutsie characters , and it 's definitely not a comedy that 's for sure ! . i would actually have given this movie 4 1 2 stars but it would n't let me ! the only reason i would n't have given it five stars is because i wish that we could 've gotten to know the main character a bit better not that it 's not great having him be a handsome mystery ! . it was also a bit harsh on my sensitive sensibilities toward the end . so if you 're as sensitive as i am BEWARE ! i would definitely give this animation a ten . it 's different but wonderfully dark . i do hope you get this ! i know you 'll enjoy it !",f,1
"Following in the footsteps of such invincible characters as Vash The Stampede Trigun and Alucard Hellsing , comes D , a dunpeal half vampire bounty hunter . This is the second installment chronicling the adventures of D the first being the original Vampire Hunter D . D is a killer of few words and even fewer friends , though he is not without a sense of honor and goodness . Initially , the plot is relatively mundane ; Charlotte , your typical damsel in distress , is abducted by a powerful aristocratic vampire named Meyer . D is commissioned by Charlotte 's family to bring back Charlotte , either dead or alive . At this point , this anime distinguishes itself from the pack when this seemingly predictable plot churns out a few signficant surprises that keeps the story running at a smooth , enthralling clip . As to what makes the movie so smooth and engrossing can be directly attributed to Vampire hunter D : Bloodlust 's superb animation . I can not reiterate enough how beautifully Bloodlust plays out on DVD . Bloodlust 's rich deep colors and sharp angles are reminiscient of Batman : The Animated Series . This being a full-feature movie , each cell of animation is meticulously drawn out . Such attention to detail brings to life the story 's dark , supernatural setting in addition to highlighting the & quot ; realistically & quot ; drawn style of the characters no cartoony , big heads here . Overall , the story wo n't lull you into a preliminary coma , while the great action and animation are sure to impress . Be sure to watch the ending , as it is my favorite part in the entire movie . It serves to reinforce the existence of D as something timeless and more than merely mortal . People come and go , kingdoms rise and fall , but D will always be there , brooding and silent as usual .",m,1
"This is the sequel to the original release back in 1984 , This time D is out to save a young woman kidnapped by the vampire meir link . The animation is as good as anything I have ever seen in anime . It ranks up there with Ghost In The Shell or anything else of this caliber . The music this time around is astoundingly good , it really made the movie and the plot is also very interesting . D is drawn to look very sharp in this movie , the detail in his face is exceptional , very smooth and fluid . Most anime is drawn to give good facial expression to bring across emotion , but D is about the best I have ever seen this time around . For any anime fan , this is an absolute must have for your collection .",m,1
This has everything the first movie had plus more . This is the same great characterization but with awesome animation . This has awesome music and a totally kickass opening . Probably the best opener to any Anime movie I 've ever seen ! BUY THIS BUY THIS BUY THIS ! !,m,1
"I just have to say that this is absolutely one of the best anime-movies I have ever seen ! The storyline is brilliant , and the graphics is really outstanding . If you are a fan of anime , I strongly advise you to add this masterpiece of film to your collection . < p > & quot ; D & quot ; has been hired to track down Meier Link , a powerful vampire who has abducted a human woman . D 's orders are strict - find Charlotte , at any cost . But he gets some competition . The Markus brothers are also hired for the same bounty . D must intercept Meier and conquer hostile forces in a deadly race against time .",m,1
"Before I review this edition of `` Tarzan 's Savage Fury '' , let me give you all the negatives ; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $ 6 less than Amazon ; there are no special features , subtitles , nor even a scene index ; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities which means you probably wo n't be able to play this on your PC . By the release of Lex Barker 's fourth film as 'Tarzan ' , audiences had accepted the boyishly handsome actor in the role , despite reduced budgets and overused stock footage . Producer Sol Lesser offered 'gimmicks ' to draw in audiences , and this film had a doozy . . . a young , orphaned white boy Tommy Carlton , being used as 'bait ' to capture alligators , is rescued by Tarzan , and for this film , at least , serves as his young ward the first time such a character had been seen since Johnny Sheffield 's 'Boy ' , during the Johnny Weismuller years . Carlton is cute , if not as feisty and athletic as Sheffield , and the Barker Carlton scenes capture some of the flavor of the 'Classic ' Tarzan films . The plot is routine , although it is a pleasure to see Edgar Rice Burroughs ' conception of Tarzan as `` Lord Greystoke '' referred to . His cousin is murdered , on safari , and substituted by a dissolute Englishman `` The Adventures of Robin Hood 's '' Patric Knowles , in a Communist plot to steal diamonds this being filmed at the height of the Cold War . While Tarzan is suspicious Charles Korvin , as the Soviet agent , is obviously untrustworthy ! , he is persuaded by Jane beautiful ex-model Dorothy Hart , in her only appearance in the series , to take the pair to a tribe with an abundance of diamonds `` to save England '' . Tarzan is incapacitated and left for dead by Korvin , Knowles repents , Jane is marked for execution by the tribe for the missing diamonds , and Carlton and Cheeta must rescue Tarzan so he can save the day ! Very short at only 81 minutes , and action-packed , `` Tarzan 's Savage Fury '' is certainly not in a league with earlier 'Tarzan ' entries , but is diverting , and offers an interesting view at the 'Red Scare ' of the 1950s . Definitely worth a look !",m,0
"As usual with Tarzan films , the title of this movie is overstated ; he does not express savage fury , although he does kill his enemy . It is fun to watch . This 1952 film is the sixteenth movie in the Tarzan series since 1932 . It is the fourth of five films in which Lex Barker has the role since he followed Johnny Weissmuller in 1949 . Two crooks with native carriers trick Tarzan into believing that one of them is his cousin . They try to persuade him to take them to a jungle tribe that has many diamonds . He refuses but , as usual , Jane gets him into trouble by persuading him to do so . En route , people get killed and the crooks steal diamonds . Jane is almost murdered by the tribe who think that she is involved . A new character , a lost white orphan is introduced ; Tarzan brings him home and Jane says he can remain . Cheetah , as in the other films , does many funny tricks .",m,1

"This movie is what the 1990s action movie on-a-budget , was all about : a low-budget , urban , martial arts action , western starring the incomparable Steve James . The story was nice . Great one-liners . . The acting was pretty good , too . Reb Brown is so over-the-top -- it 's perfect ! ! Wall -to-wall fisticuffs . *The final fight scene against the multiple assailants in the warehouse seems to go on forever Tony Jaa , 'The Protector ' , would love it ! ! -- and I was so pumped , after it was over , I wanted to go fight 63 guys too -- ! ! This movie is a classic , and should be released on DVD with all the extras . This would a fitting tribute to the great Steve James .",m,1
"NANA is a story about two girls with the same name who randomly meet while going to pursue their dreams of making it big in Tokyo .

Her friend , Hachi their nickname in the story for the non-singer Nana dreams of finding her perfect soul mate and love in the big city . There is more to the adventures of these two ladies but their friendship is the glue that holds the tale together .

I love this show ! It 's one of my favorites . And this box set is amazing ! ! ! I ca n't wait for the new ones to come out !,m,1
this video is a must have for anyone who enjoys the doors . Val Kilmner 's portrayal of Jim Morrison is the best thing that he has ever done . you will swear that he is posessed by the spirit of Morrison . Meg Ryan as Pam completes this tale of late 60 's drug crazed rock and roll . Get it you wo n't regret it .,f,1
"Last night 's bargain-rack movie was `` The Doors , `` a film by Oliver Stone . If you enjoy rock 'n ' roll and the life-style that seems to be associated with it , then you might enjoy this film . The Doors were a rock group whose leader , Jim Morrison , was a beach dude from Venice , California , and who 's personal theme song was `` The World Owes Me A Living . `` Jim met up with another Venice beach person who liked his poetry and first thing you know a couple other guys joined and they put together a band which quickly became popular . It was on to Whiskey A Go-Go , a Los Angeles dive for up and coming bands , then on to San Francisco , a recording contract and off to New York City , all in a very short time span . Burning the candle at both ends became a way of life . The Doors fame quickly grew and their records hit big-time and the funding rolled in . Jim Morrison 's ego quickly inflated to mega-proportions and he began to hold everyone in contempt , his venue owners , the police , his loyal girlfriend , his band-mates and , ultimately , even his fans , while he proclaimed that life was n't worth living and that he wanted to die . His intake of intoxicants was prodigious and he favored hard booze , guzzled straight from the bottle . His shows gradually became intoxicated brawls until , finally , he died of heart problems at the old age of 29 . Okay , I 've glossed it over a bit but that 's the general gist . It 's an interesting story and the general outline fits more than one rock group . The movie was quite excellent . Well done ! The acting was believable . You could actually feel as if you 're a member of the entourage and are going through this ridiculous rise and fall right along with Morrison and the band . Most of the Doors songs have faded with 60s memories , but it 's good hearing them again in the context of the times . . The Doors have become music critics legendary darlings so a lot of interesting extra materials are included on a second disc . It 's a worthwhile DVD packet , whether you liked the Doors or not .

"This has n't aged well since I first saw it in like 1997 in high school . Oliver Stone directs this power film starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison , front man singer for rock group The Doors . The main thing here is the rock star excess of jim Morrison played well by Kilmer . The rest of the band takes a back sit in this cool chiller about Jim Morrison who rocked the late 60s and early 70s . The Doors ' music is no longer shocking after living through the rise of black metal and the punk revival . I would recommend it to anyone , though a masterpiece it 's not any more . I still enjoy Doors ' music reissues on CD .",m,0
"what can i say , a classic movie about a classic rock band on high def blue ray . . . . . get it .",m,1
"This is the best rock movie ever made . Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time . This is a film he gets less credit for , but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done . First of all , he nails the life of Jim Morrison , the story of The Doors , and the L . A . Scene 1960s as perfectly as it can be done . It is beyond nostalgoia , it is time travel . As great as Stone 's use of Doors songs , scenery , drug use and beautiful , heavily-decorated '60s California girls is , it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest . Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks . Next on the agenda , you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on , irritating Ray Manzarek . To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors , everything is flawless . The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene , particularly Morrison urinating at Barney 's Beanery , which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe . The feeling watching `` The Doors '' switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led , and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it . Love my girl !",m,1
This was the part that Val Kilmer was born to play . The music in the movie just makes you trip away from the very beginning . It 's fantastic . I love the Doors . This is a must have for any Door 's fan .,m,1
This is a great quality product and quick shipping . The movie is great depicting the era of the great rock n roll bands . This type of musical talent no longer exists in `` today 's '' bands .,m,1
"This was a wonderful film , ValKilmer 's best in my opinion . As Jim Morrison Kilmer gets to the core of the inner and oft hidden demons with all of us . Although achieving wealth , fame and success Morrisson is haunted by a mystical figure who appears to be calling him toward his destiny a destiny which Jim seems so eager to meet and embrace . Morrison personifies all that was rock and roll in the 60 's , sex drugs and seeminly a taste for pushing ones'self to the limits of physical and psychological exhausion . I highly recommend this .",m,1
"Formed by Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek at a night on the beach after Jim read some of his poems to Ray , The Doors became one of the greatest rock bands of all time in the late 60s . Jim Morrison was one of the first rock n roll rebels and wrote some of the darkest , deepest songs ever `` The End '' , `` Strange Days '' , etc . Even Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 started a band themselves after being mesmerized at a Doors concert . The band started in 1965 , and released their first album in 1967 , and sadly the original band ended in 1971 , due to Jim Morrison 's unfortunate death . Oliver Stone 's film is more about Jim Morrison than the band , to be honest . Val Kilmer 's performance is so convincing , you 'd think you 're watching Jim in the film and in some shots , you are ! . It has been said that even the surviving Doors members had trouble distinguishing Kilmer 's vocals from Morrison 's own . Val Kilmer should 've at least been nominated for an oscar . The actors playing the other Doors members Kyle MacLachlan , Kevin Dillion , and Frank Whaley have some screen time , but as I said , the movie is basically about Jim . I think this is an excellent bio-pic , but some would disagree . So , check it out if you 're a fan , or even if you are n't a fan . It 's a masterpiece . Oh , and Oliver Stone is an admitted fanatic Morrison fan , in interviews he has said that he views him as something of a god .",m,1
"When I saw `` The Doors : Special Edition '' I hoped that Oliver Stone would have added additional footage into the movie that was originally taken out for time . That was n't the case . The film remains as it has since it 's release , and the only addition is a second DVD included with `` The Road of Excess '' documentary , a small featurette and interviews with some of the cast , and of course , Oliver Stone himself . While the extra DVD does shed some additional light on the film , I do n't believe it adds anything of significance to the original film Oliver Stone presented in 1991 . I gave it 4 stars because of the film itself , the bonus DVD deserves 2 stars .",m,1
"In 1991 director Oliver Stone made two epics concerning the 1960s , `` JFK '' and `` The Doors '' . In my humble opinion , Stone was most successful with `` The Doors '' in evoking the spirit of that tumultuous time in American history . You can feel and taste the ambiance of the Sunset Strip and the smoky clubs that the Doors used as their stomping grounds . But who 's kidding who ; the Doors were a vehicle for the musings of their charasmatic leader , Jim Morrison , and the rest of the band were able sidemen . Val Kilmer so eerily channels the spirit of Morrison in his performance here that you feel that you are actually witnessing the rise and downward spiral of the Lizard King himself . The cast here includes many talented individuals Meg Ryan , Kyle Maclachlan , Frank Whaley , Kevin Dillon but essentially they are but straight men to the Morrison show . The reason I rate this film four stars instead of five is indicative of the fact that this is ultimately not an easy film to watch . It 's something of a chore to witness the self-destruction of a talented individual through his own narcissistic indulgences .",m,1
"is what this movie should have been titled . Jim Morrison appears drunk and high in 99 . 9 % of the scenes in this movie which I found dissapointing . Val Kilmer does a GREAT job as the Doors frontman . Maybe it 's because I grew up in the late 70 's , but I did n't really understand Oliver Stone 's need to show us what it 's like to be on acid and all the while reciting weirdo poetry like Morrison does in this movie . . . I mean , what 's with the indians , snakes , etc ? I would have prefered a straight story on the band , this movie is about Jim Morrison . It 's an interesting and different movie that 's for sure . The dvd menus are cool . . . like something from the 1960 's .",m,0
"Looks brand new , not a scratch on the DVD . One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $ 3 ! ! !",f,1
"Jim Morrison was a self-indulgent hack of a songwriter , but he was a man with charisma to spare . It sometimes amazes he that his shoddy mythologizing passes for poetic expression , but then I listen to his voice : Not technically beautiful , but lusty , ringing , and enormous , it redeems some of his missteps and makes them into great rock songs like & quot ; Break on Through & quot ; and & quot ; LA Woman & quot ; . Oliver Stone , on the other hand , is no hack , but like Morrison , he is overambitious and self-indulgent . It makes sense that he would make a film about the Doors ' frontman . The result is an enormous film that is very nearly derailed by Stone 's irritating mannerisms and bloated , overheated directing , but maybe that 's fitting : A bloated , overheated rock star deserves a bloated , overheated biopic . The best part about the film by far is Val Kilmer 's mezmerizing performance as the Lizard King himself , and man is it a great part -- to me , it ranks with De Niro in & quot ; Taxi Driver , & quot ; Washington in & quot ; Malcom X , & quot ; and Brando in & quot ; On the Waterfront & quot ; as one of the finest of all time . Unfortunately , Stone is unwilling to let his star carry the picture and thereby outshine the director , and so the whole enterprise comes this close to crashing down in flames .",m,0
Highly entertaining film about the Doors rise to fame . The music is great . Not to be missed .,f,1
"This film takes you through the history of the Doors starting in Vanice Beach California where they break through and rise to stardom . Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild , ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band . Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life . It flows through the timeline showing all the true aspects of Jim 's poetic personality . Fabulously portrayal of Jim Morrison and very entertaining .",m,1
"Although I have never agreed with drug use at all , I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors . and many other groups of the 60 's and 70 's . . . I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer , and he is awesome in this role . The movie is very well made , the music is fantastic , the storyline is wonderful , yet so sad . . . I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors . . .",f,1
"For those of us who grew up in the 1960s , this is a wonderful film . It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time , that all old forms could be swept away , that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future . Of course we were wrong , and those who embodied all the hope and excess , like Morrison , paid the price with their lives - they were drunk , drugged out , and many eventually died of it . Looking back on it , I feel amazed at how naive we were , how arrogant , but then , we were children and youths , affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless . This film accurately portrays that feeling , both in its pathetic over-reaching , but also a lot of the beauty of it . This is the best Stone film by far , and I was n't even into the Doors . Warmly recommended .",m,1
"Brilliant . The film starts out with The Doors , and then takes on a life of its own , becoming a cult object in the process , an objet d'art , breathless , entwined , twirling , obsessive , relentless , varicoloured . . . It 's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final , musical , passionate , finale .",m,1
"If you just want to have a good time and not worry about details related to biography , this is the perfect The Doors movie .",f,1
"This was a good show in all . Very Trippy ! ! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it ? ? heehee ! Billy played & quot ; Kat & quot ; . He had brown long hair and was on crutches . He was briefly at the bar . Be careful . . . if you blink , you 'll miss him ! ! : o",f,1
"'The Doors ' were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the sixties and the quintessential California group of the decade . They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream . What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison ? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs , alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture ? Or is Jims ' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century ? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways ' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God ? Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime . Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic , shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing , or ready to accept . A truly remarkable accomplishment . As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison , it could n't have been better . His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary . Without question Val was born to play this role . Did Jim really believe he was the `` Electric Shaman '' called by the spirits to open the `` Doors of Perception '' to a sleeping world ? Was he Dionysus reborn , here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring ' with `` Golden copulations in the streets of L . A . `` More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster ' leading us once again in the wrong direction . Maybe it 's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert . `` It 's just a dream Jimmy , that 's all it is . `` So relax , show no fear , `` Kiss the Snake '' and enjoy the ride !",m,1
"Hey , I know I 'm in the minority in my opinion here on Amazon , yet I will state unequivocally my view that the portrayal of Jim Morrison , his common-law wife Pamela Courson , the group , and even the supporting cast of regulars in The Doors Universe come off like characters in search of a serious screenwriter . Come on already , Oliver . Who could sympathize with Jim and Company when they spew out lines of dialogue clipped , of all places , from Morrison 's song lyrics ? Did you actually think an audience would accept Jim uttering such discordant lines in an everyday conversation ? Could you not separate the man from the performer ? Because of that awful bit of writing , Jim comes off like a buffoon , not an erudite talent who , despite a lifetime of loneliness , alienation , and addictive tendencies which would ultimately snuff out his life , still managed to push aside material comfort for a pursuit of the truth as he saw it . Also , how come Jim revels in such horrible psychobabble ? Had you not gleamed the interviews available through Bright Midnight and other retailers you 'd hear an incredibly bright , articulate young man who lamented the day he elected to be part of a rock and roll band . You 'd also have the makings of excellent drama , as a man who can not escape his fame and a man who longed to create films and poetry in his own right . How could one ever sympathize with a drunken lout YOUR Jim who acts like an ass seems more like Val Kilmer playing himself rather than Jim , shows no compassion whatsoever , and just appears to become famous in one quick turn of events . The only clue we have to the success stems from the Sullivan show , the airport raid , and assorted concerts , but we never get a sense of Jim being nationally lambasted . Some archival footage might have helped there . But of course then the more sedate , intelligent Morrison -- whom you portrayed as bumping into cops whereas Jim preferred to sway at a mike stand see the archival footage -- does n't figure in a Hollywood biopic . What a shame . What a rotten , dirty , salacious mess . Maybe your own demons got the better of your good sense , Oliver . God knows , if your Morrison had been the true Morrison , I 'd never had been a fan of his in the first place . Thanks for turning Jim into David Lee Roth , the members of KISS , Robert Plant , and all those other Circus Magazine posterboys for rock and roll excess . Too bad . An integrity , a nonmaterial nature , and a sincere attraction to make art distinguishes Jim from all those other Sex , Drug , and Rock and Roller hellions .",m,0
"First , let me start off by saying that Val Kilmer 's performance in this film is nothing short of genius . He literally became Jim Morrison , almost to the point that I thought that Val was actually a mental patient who thought he WAS Jim Morrison . There are many times during the film that I had to tell myself that it was n't Jim that had come back from the dead . Second , Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and he can make the viewer feel as if he has just stepped into a time machine and gone back to visit the 60 's -- that 's how authentic the setting is in this movie . However , the problem that I sometimes have with Oliver Stone is that he has a tendancy to go a little to overboard in his films , and `` The Doors '' is a perfect example of this . We all know that Jim Morrison was a troubled soul , but , hey , let 's face it -- most of your artistic geniuses are , which what makes their work so incredible . Stone , however , made Jim Morrison out to be some acid-draining Nazi that cared only about himself and had violent outbursts all the time . In reality , though , if one does a little research , one finds out that Jim was only like that some of the time and not every second of his life . This movie , I felt , failed to show more of the beautiful maverick poet shaman that Jim , most of the time , really was . Also , I felt that the sex angle was overplayed a bit , as well . Obviously Jim had slept with a number of women , and the women that were n't able to , most likely fantasized about being with Jim . However , it was if this film made Jim out to be so horny that he would actually have sex with mannequins at the local department store . In reality , when all is said and done , the only real saving grace of this film was Val Kilmer 's outstanding performance as well as Stone 's accurate re-creation of the trippin ' sixties .",m,0
"If you love the real Doors , stay clear of this miasma . The Doors , I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time , but this vapid flick , created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late , great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish , idiotic and talenless goofballs . This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry . I may just have to re-read for the third time No One Here Gets Out Alive , and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer 's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt .",m,0
"I saw this movie when it first came out March 1 , 1991 . I was 21 years old , and a huge DOORS fan . I liked it okay back then , but upon seeing it now , it 's boring , and makes it appear that the other members did little or nothing to contribute to the band and its success Robby Krieger , the guitar player , WROTE 'LIGHT MY FIRE ' . I think Val Kilmer does an Oscar-caliber job as Jim , but the others are only there to react to things Jim says and does . They have no other purpose except to fill in those roles-most anyone could have done that . I do n't think a lot of people realize that Jim Morrison was many things , BUT HE WAS N'T A MUSICIAN . HE DID N'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT , and he was n't THAT great a singer though I will say that he was damn good when he was good . THE DOORS were a great band , but that was a long time ago . As far as the studio albums go , the first two were great , the second two were mediocre though 'STRANGE DAYS ' has a couple of decent tracks , and the last two were hit and miss . I was n't there , so I do n't know about how they were live videos and live CDs are NOT THE SAME as being there . Another reviewer said that Meg Ryan was a poor choice to play Pam . I agree . Listening to Stone talk about it on disc 2 tells us why . Ryan sounds like she was is unable to comprehend the type of behavior that Pam Jim engaged in , i . e . drugs , rebellion , etc . Stone said the same thing about Darryl Hannah regarding her failed attempt to play Darian in WALL STREET a far superior movie to this one by the way . I do n't understand why Stone would choose to have someone play a role like this when they obviously were unable to 'find and be ' the character they were supposed to be portraying . Stone should have chosen more wisely . I think Stone 's obsession with Jim is the reason this movie is really all about Jim . Of the many problems in it , the one that probably bothers me the most is that the movie acts like Jim is the center of the universe , as the camera is almost always on him . But Oliver Stone 's Jim Morrison is juvenile , destructive , obnoxious , and often , pointless . He hardly comes off as a genius , poetic or otherwise . He suddenly has star status , but the movie does n't show why-we 're supposed to know why . Yet , why should we care ? ? ? The character is despicable , at least that 's the way he 's written here . I could n't even finish the film-I simply did n't care that he was headed for a youthful demise . When I read 'Riders on the Storm ' and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive ' , I found myself caring about the people involved-not here though . Moreover , the photography was irritating , to say the least . I wanted to know about THE DOORS , instead , I got an MTV-type drug trip with DOORS music behind it . As a big studio movie , I think this fails on all levels except one-Val Kilmer 's performance . As another reviewer noted , this is the best acting he 's ever done . It 's too bad that the movie script he had to work with was is over-hyped junk .",m,0
This movie transported me back to the 60 's . It brought back some great memories . The sound track is excellent ! ! ! ! !,m,1
"The particular filmography of Oliver Stone has had peak and lows . He is - before any other circumstance - a CSI filmmaker . His camera is an untiring explorer of facts , livings and memories . That is why my personal list of his treasures films possibly do not include his most succesful works . This is one of my three favorite Opus of Stone ; my other tweo choice are JFK and Wall Street . This movie works out as historical document , due its shocking realism but the the loyal refelect of USA in those ages . Being an exception figure O . S . innquires and carves in releief the expectations , defeats and livings of whole generation , tired of waiting who felt Jim Morrison was the icon of his generation , the direct descendent of the beatnik ages headed by Alan Gingsberg and Andy Warhol . The script is so well built and the performances are so natural and spontaneous ; the towering acting of Kilmer and the fabulous scenaries conform a majuscule and interweaved puzzle of multidimensional resonance . Recommended without reserves .",m,1
"This is an excellent film about Jim Morrison and the Doors . While it is true that it is not completely accurate Oliver Stone directed it so how would it be and is sometimes way over the top it is still an entertaining and intresting movie . I 've watched it several times I love the Doors and Jim and it holds up to the repeated views . If you like classic rock or the Doors then I would encourage this because it is a great picture of the 60 's and of Jim . Val Kilmer does a superb job as Jim . He looks , speaks and even sings like Jim . Meg Ryan is good as his wife . Anyways I highly reccomend this !",m,1
"The first time I watched this movie was at a party . I had no clue who The Doors were , was n't really paying attention , and never really saw the ending , however something clicked . The next day I went to rent the movie and really sit down and watch it . I never had a thing for Val Kilmer as an actor or really cared about Oliver Stone movies either . But after watching this movie made me fall in love with the Door 's music . After buying all their albums and books and reading into the band I found that the movie was not really exact in the band and the life of Jim . And the band members today say they were upset with the movie . However , die hard fan or someone that wants to visit the era in a movie , will enjoy this flick . Watch this movie as entertainment the way Oliver Stone wanted you to see it and not necessarily to get their life story . The movie is filled with some of the best Doors songs there are and can take you back to the era that many people wish never ended . Val Kilmer played an excellent role looking and even voicing Jim . If you are somewhat interested in the band , the era , or slipping away from reality for a couple hours , I highly recommend this movie !",m,1
"I just watched this movie again a few days ago , and the photography sticks in my mind . There are more special effects in The Doors than in Star Wars . I think this movie represents a change in Oliver Stone 's career . I did n't like some of his earlier films as much as other people . The most interesting films to me were the ones where he used a lot of special photography to convey the message like JFK , Nixon , Any Given Sunday , even Natural Born Killers although I think Killers hits a doorstop in the prison scenes . There are scenes in Killers that have the kind of visual exuberance and improvisations inherent in the message , almost like a fairy tale . The Doors uses cinema the way Apocalypse Now uses cinema . What I mean by that is the montages , the feeling of immersion , the adult manner in which the cinema handles the plot . It pulls out the stops and goes as deep as the mental state it portrays without being too `` preachy '' . Those are Stone 's preferable qualities to me . The Oliver Stone films lacking those presentation techniques I speak of were shot so gritty to the extent of degrading the moral , and they had little beauty or gloss in them , which are the things that were put into The Doors and the above few I mentioned . Stone 's better films are the ones like this one that treats his subjects as fairy tales for adults . They are the ones that take me on a colorful ride and display what those things look like in one 's imagination , and then plays with them like fairy tales . They should be vivid and colorful . They should not make me hate the world , but have me make better choices in the world . If you are interested in Oliver Stone in the same manner , you may also want to read his book , A Child 's Night Dream .",m,1
"Val Kilmer might as well be Jim Morrison reincarnate . He was too good for the part . It was beyond amazing . . . it was downright eerie . From Jim 's singing talking voice , all the way to his maneurisms and his drug-addiction and his beliefs , and what he looked like . . . Val Kilmer got it all . All I can say is , somehow , JIM MORRISON WAS HAUNTING THIS FILM . Because of that , and because of the incredible supporting cast , really hot women , and the splended choice of songs used for the movie , The Doors is an amazing masterpiece about an incredible rock group . I wish I had been alive in that time to truly see the Doors live instead of being forced to see their concerts on TV and on DVD . This DVD is an awesome bio-movie about the band , and about Jim Morrison . And about Val Kilmer . . . I had first seen Val Kilmer act as Batman in Batman Forever , and after that , I did n't think too highly of his acting skills . It was an okay Batman , but he just did n't do that good . But then I saw this movie , and I began looking at what else Val Kilmer has done , and I realized , it was n't Val Kilmer who sucked in Batman Forever It was just his bad luck that he had to read that particular script . . . it was Robin and the mediocrity of the movie itself . As I said above , it was eerie watching him play Jim Morrison . The DVD also has great features , a lot of Deleted Scenes that I think should be put back into the movie , and over-all is very worth-it . Now , an unrated one with all those Deleted Scenes put back in would be incredible .",m,1
". . . Mr . Kilmer is dead-on as the Lizard King , the & quot ; band & quot ; nails the look of a band really performing and the trippy visuals are all in the spirit of the era from which the Doors sprang . Man , either rock or get the hell out of the way . . .",m,1
"This movie changed my perspective of Rock n ' Roll intensely . This movie was so gratifying , it gave me chills , it also made me sort of understand Morrison more . Val Kilmer portrayed such a terrific roll as Morrison , I acually believed it was Morrison instead of the actor . I love the doors . I dont think the movie could be any better or any worse . Thumbs up to Oliver STONE . JIM MORRISON LIVES",f,1
"This movie was excellent . Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison impeccably . This movie really gave me a look into The Doors and really entertained me . I 'd Reccommend this movie for anyone who likes The Doors or music from that time . I enjoyed it , before the movie I did n't know too much about Jim Morrison or The Doors but now I am a Doors fan . This movie is a must-see",m,1
"This overlong biopic of Jim Morrison Val Kilmer is most interesting early on as it details the rise to fame of the Doors . Soon , however , Morrison surrenders himself completely to drugs and the film spirals into a long series of repetitive scenes in which Morrison abuses himself and others . The main reason to watch this film is Kilmer 's incredible performance . To impersonate a man whose look and sound are so well-known without descending into characature is a true acting achievement . Unfortnately , writer-director Oliver Stone dotes on Morrison 's sophomoric paens to death and self-centered spiritual explorations so minutely that he often comes across as an unquestioning syncophant . The greatest narrative achievement of the film is showing how such a self-destructive person can maintain a career -- at least for a while -- through the efforts of those around him who feel that the talent he offers justifies the garbage they have to put up with .",m,0
"I should preface this by stating I really do NOT like Oliver Stone movies other than Natural Born Killers , for some reason I feel very disconnected to them . And he does it again with the Doors . On the recommendation of my son I watched this on a borrow and I have to say I watched the entire run of the movie and still know NOTHING about THE DOORS . The movie is instead filled with psychedelic filler of the highest order and Jim Morrison comes off as nothing more than a sullen drunken crybaby . All the relationships seemed forced and nothing about this era or group seemed interesting at all , and I have to think that 's simply not true in real life . A lot has been made of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and for all the hype I 've heard I can say I was mildly let down , which could be more a fault of the script since NO ONE not even the lead had any type of depth or worthwhile backstory , so what more can an actor do ? I actually thought Meg Ryan was the stand out , and that does n't say a lot .",m,0
"I went to see this film the night it was released in Seattle . Not because it interested me so much but more because I had a friend who really wanted to see it when it came out and could n't . He liked to see films immediately upon their release . I liked to do things that irked him , so I made sure to see the film before he did . This was a surprising film , really . When I heard that Val Kilmer had been cast as Jim Morrison , I , like many , was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off . The Val Kilmer we had to that point come to recognise looked nothing like Morrison in addition to which , Kilmer 's roles had never really stretched his `` acting muscles '' , so most were convinced that he would fail . However , Kilmer respectably fooled everyone with his convincing portrayal of Morrison . His performance was enjoyable . Meg Ryan was surprising also because her role was a bit of a departure . Still did n't like her , though . Kathleen Quinlan 's blood drinking gothic diversion for Morrison was an interesting character . The story was not thrilling , as we all know the story , and in fact , many parts of the film were simply laughable . I noticed at the end when Morrison decides to move to Paris and is saying goodbye to his friends other Doors members , he and the friends hug and not only do they perform that special `` man hug '' which is a hug always accompanied by several hard slaps on the back . . . very manly but also accompanied with tender sentiments like , `` I 'm gon na miss you '' followed by the tempering insult , `` you a**hole '' . No niceties for the sake of niceties . We all know Jim 's fate . . . you can visit him in the P & egrave ; re Lachaise cemetery in Paris .",f,0
"this movie is hogwash . oliver stone blew it with this one . With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made . its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did ! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat , morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell . Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to care anything about him or his art . the movie is a mixed up mess `` IS EVERYBODY IN '' Gee i hope not !",m,0
"Oliver Stone , a great director in general , really slacks off in this one ! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but , Meg Ryan as Pam . . . only in a dream world . All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded . Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story along . All in all a very good story but , not nearly an accurate depiction of Jims ' rise and fall",f,0
"This is Oliver Stone 's best film , Val Kilmer 's best performance , and the 2d best fiction film representation of a rock band This Is Spinal Tap is the best , of course . But first , the bad news : Stone 's miscogyny nearly sinks the film . Morrison 's significant other , Pamela Courson , was by all accounts , a tough as nails hippy chick who had the measure of her man . Jim was as devoted to her as he could be to a woman , and while both strayed often , they always came back to each other . Doors songs memorializing their relationship , like `` Queen of the Highway , `` are a window into what Ray Manzarek termed a great love story . In the film , poor Meg Ryan an excellent physical match for Pam plays her as a nagging whiny scold , always trying to stop our hero from doing whatever it is a man 's got ta do . Nothing could have been further from the truth , as Pam 's refusal to put Jim on a leash was what kept them together . Her character is intolerable in the flick , just like Sissy Spacek 's performance as Jim Garrison 's wife in JFK and Daryl Hannah 's in Wall Street , and is likely more representative of Stone 's relationships with sundry long-suffering ex-wives than Pam and Jim . Stone 's miscogny rears its ugly head again in his slander of Nico , the ethereal , brilliant ice goddess , here depicted as a balloon-breasted nekkid bimbo . Ugh . These 2 dead women are sadly not around to kick Stone 's butt for the injustice committed herein . Second : for a movie called `` The Doors , `` Robby Krieger , John Densmore , and Ray Manzarek are relegated to the background of the film . Morrison deferred to them in all matters artistic , and in return they provided him with a splendid musical carpet , backing his every unpredictable move every step of the way . While the film does justice to the music , it barely acknowledges the contribution of the musicians , without whom Morrison knew and acknowledged he was nothing . Character-wise , they seem like low-key versions of Pam , bemused and upset by Jim 's antics where I suspect in real life they were enablers and facilitors and collaborators . Now the good : perhaps because and not in spite of the fact Stone was stuck in the jungles of Vietnam while this story was being played out , as an imaginative re-creation of The Summer of Love and its dark aftermath , this film is nonpareil . Every detail of decor and costume , every location , seems dead-on accurate . [ except for the fact that the women who pack the gigs look like they just tumbled off a casting couch . . . ] I think Stone relished making up for the '60 's he missed , and threw himself into the project with discipline and love . Think of this as the homefront story playing out behind Platoon and Born on the 4th of July . . . The concert scenes are phenomenal , orchestrated chaos spiraling out of control , while the ring-leader looks on with a bemused , ironic detatchment , not quite knowing what to make of the mindless Dionysian energies he has un-leashed in his audience . Morrison speaks to Stone : both are products of the counterculture gestalt , both are artists who mix vast talent with vast pretension , excess , bombast , a boatload of drugs , and macho nonsense in equal measure . Stone 's aesthetic failings are also Morrison 's great pop star wretched poet , so the weaknesses of the film do n't really hurt the movie , they make it seem more true to Mr Mojo Risin 's messed up genius . Finally -- Val Kilmer . This performance incarnation is flat-out uncanny . Beyond capturing the obvious -- the looks , the voice , the stance , the charisma -- Kilmer also catches the irony and anti-star compulsions ; his bemused role-playing when he poses for cheesecake photos for the cover of 16 magazine , his desire to shake up his audience by all the means at his disposal , his willful physical degeneration , pulling the plug on his Pop Star persona by turning himself into a tubby bearded wino bluesman in record time . Kilmer never lets us forget Morrison was something of a clown , waiting and watching to see what would happen next when he ventured out further on the edge , appreciating the absurdity of the endeavor . Kilmer 's sense of humor and self-mockery is what saves the movie from pretension , as it ultimately saves Morrison 's art . Formally , this movie initiated the chaotic visual style , expressionist psychedelic agit-prop , which Stone brought to fruition in subsequent films like JFK , Natural Born Killers , and Nixon . The film seems to careen out of control , but Stone 's hand is firmly on the tiller . By the time we get to the legendary Miami concert that basically ended the band 's career , with Kilmer Morrison exhorting his equally whacked-out audience to follow him all the way , but clueless as to the destination , the swirling disembodied camera , perfectly re-created music , and wild montage really puts us in the heart of an epoch long past -- I really felt like i was there . Warts and all , a classic .",m,1
"This film somewhat disappointed me . I walked away from this film thinking that Jim Morrison was an alcoholic jerk who cared only about himself . Thankfully , soon after watching this movie I read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive ' and I have come to see a better picture of the true Jim Morrison . It seems as if Hollywood is only interested in the abusive side of Morrison and not the more down-to-earth side of Morrison . Oliver Stone made Jim 's character so one dimensional . . . and this is a serious flaw in a movie that is based , for the mostpart , on one man . That being said , Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Jim Morrison . The movie has many fantastic parts : the making of 'Light My Fire ' , the cinematography in Jim 's desert peyote scene , the Miami concert . It is a great film to watch , but definitely read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive ' if you want to understand the more human side of Jim Morrison . 4 5",m,1
"Surely Jim Morrison 's life was n't as debauched as Oliver Stone presents it in THE DOORS 1991 . The film plays like a rock music gang bang . OK , not exactly , but if Jimmy was THAT physically active would n't he have had a case of terminal johnson blisters ? Recently seeing this movie again reminded me of how handsome Val Kilmer was in his youth . Physically he makes a superb Morrison , can even sing like the man . Yes , the music is just great here and the actors playing the other members of the Doors work well in their roles . Crispin Glover 's Andy Warhol is also interesting in a creepy sort of way , but this film is good only up to a point . The early story works best , and then you get to that vampire sequence , geez . And how about Meg Ryan 's elevator surprise ? If I saw what she encountered that night I 'd be outta there on the next flight to San Berdoo . Yet Pamela Courson stuck around for more heartbreak , and more , and more , and . . . Director Stone must have a message here . Surely it is n't : do n't shoot too many scenes with a red filter ? With Morrison Kilmer overdrugging , overdrinking , oversexing , overeating and overschmoozing , it has to be : all things in moderation . In a two year period , Janis Joplin died of heroin and booze , Jim Morrison passed away in a bathtub from a heroin OD and Jimi Hendrix asphixiated while regurgitating the 9 sleeping pills he 'd swallowed , which apparently was 8½ too many . All were only 27 . All had made wondrous music . The word `` tragedy '' does n't begin to describe how Janis , Jim and Jimi left us , and what the world lost in potential new songs as a result . Their deaths marked a turning point in music and in how we fans lived our own lives . Epilogue : Three years after Jim left her , Pamela Courson also died of a heroin overdose . Like the others , Pamela was only 27 years old .",f,0
"I think The Doors are one of the greatest bands in rock history . I also think that no one else will ever possess the presence or talent that Jim Morrison did , especially with the way rock `` music '' is going these days I mean , Limp Bizkit was popular a few years ago , if that says anything about where rock is headed . I 'm not an Oliver Stone fan particularly . I 've never seen JFK , and Natural Born Killers seems to have a sort of following behind it , but I honestly did n't see any redeeming qualities about that movie . So when I saw that Oliver Stone was the director of the movie about my favorite band , although I was excited to watch it , I truthfully was n't expecting very much . I bought it before watching it and still own it . Although I 've seen it many times , I 'm still conflicted as to how I feel about it . It seems that the movie , although true to The Doors and how they got together and their rise to fame , did not do Jim justice at all . It had nothing to do with Val Kilmer , he was perfect as Jim , especially the live performance scenes ; I 've watched many Doors live performances and how Val embodied Jim in that respect was really amazing . I do think he over-did it sometimes-the pouty thing he did drove me nuts and the photo shoot scene made me laugh it was so cheesy . All in all though , I loved Val as Jim . Yet the movie seemed to show only one aspect of who Morrison was-on the road to excess , out of control , drunken , womanizing . Sure he 's a rock star , but I would have loved to know more about who he REALLY was , because I feel the movie did n't delve into that . I 'm positive there was much more to him than the drunken rock star even if it was the truth , that 's not all of who he was . Ray Manzarek said it best `` It was not about Jim Morrison . It was about Jimbo Morrison , the drunk . God , where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy ? The guy I knew was not on that screen . `` I give the movie three stars because aside from my criticisms of it , it 's essentially a good movie by an okay director about an amazing band . Damn you Oliver Stone , why could n't a better director with a better screenplay have done this movie , who knows what could have been .",f,0
"`` The Doors '' is the greatest of all rock movies , in the years since it was first released in 1991 it has gained a weird kind of cult status , it is popular among young rockers and teenagers as it is among the adults who belong to the generation first grabbed by `` Light My Fire . `` The film is directed by cinema madman and virtuoso , Oliver Stone , who was a Doors fan when serving in Vietnam and here conceives a movie that is big in scope and excess , in other words , it stays true to the spirit of it 's subject . People including Doors organist Ray Manzarek have attacked Stone and movie for dramatic license and fictional inventions , but the Morrison myth has grown so large that it is hard to even trust the accounts of people like Manzarek who enjoys pouring gasoline into the myth 's fire and so the movie should be taken for what it is , a MOVIE . And man , it is one of the great rock spectacles ever dramatized on film . Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance , dressed in the black leather pants and long hair , he gives a stunning performance because we never doubt it is Jim Morrison dancing around on the screen , the effect is even more enhanced because Kilmer sang most of the concert scenes in the DVD commentary , Stone informs us Kilmer sang ALL of the 1969 Miami concert sequence and as a performer , he has a pretty good voice . The movie captures not only the madness of Morrison , but also the atmosphere and lore of his music . The movie uses no score , it imploys the Doors songs to create the mood while squeezing in `` Venus In Furs '' by Velvet Underground and the classic opus `` Carmina Burana '' . There are moments of insansity and excess that create a hypnotic intensity driven by the rich , dreamy photography by Robert Richardson , and there are even , amidst the sex , drugs and rock n ' roll , some moments of romantic sweetness in a poetic way when Morrison rhymes for his girl Pamela Courson played by Meg Ryan . Stone used completely live audiences for the concert sequences , which are exhilarating and stunning , especially a gothic sequence in San Francisco when the band performs `` Not To Touch The Earth . `` Any Doors fan will love this film , especially since the soundtrack , featuring all the greats like `` Break On Through , `` `` Backdoor Man , `` `` Light My Fire , `` `` Strange Days , `` `` The Crystal Ship '' and `` Five To One '' pulses with the Doors sound , and hearing Kilmer deliver his own performances is a treat no Doors afficionado or rock enthusiast should miss . `` The Doors '' is thrilling , hypnotic and a fiery experience of great rock n ' roll .",m,1
"I avoided this movie when it first came out , and I avoided it for about 10 years afterward , because I heard that it was such a travesty . Recently , I received the DVD as a Christmas gift . Out of respect to the person who gave it to me , I decided to watch it at least once . I was very pleasantly surprised . . . and physically and emotionally exhausted by the movie 's end . True , Oliver Stone 's version of the Doors ' legend is n't dead-on accurate , but I think the realism and accuracy were only sacrificed in order to make a greater visceral and artistic impact , which I believe is something Jim Morrison might have understood . The whole point of this movie is to revel in its excesses , and on that point , the movie scores everytime . And remember that this is the story as filtered through Stone 's own perception , not a docudrama . Kudos to Val Kilmer , whose portrayal of Jim Morrison was just as uncanny as I 'd heard . Where 's his Oscar ? I really dug this movie , even as a Doors fan who knows the true history as heard from the band . And if you can experience it as the Bacchanalian epic it 's meant to be , and just take in all the sights and sounds , then you 'll really dig it , too .",m,1
"I was not a big fan of `` The Doors '' musical group until I watched this film . I feel Val Kilmer did an incredible performance as Jim Morrison . To learn later that Mr Kilmer actually sang most of the songs in the film himself , blew me away . I feel this film was before it 's time . And Mr Kilmer should have been nominated for the performance . They nominated that actor for `` Ray '' and he did not even sing in the movie . I gave this movie 5 stars , for all the incredible acting done in this film especially Val Kilmer & Meg Ryan .",f,1
"This movie is a very insightful look into the Doors and Jim Morrison 's life . However , if you really want an accurate history I would read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore .",m,1
"I am not a `` diehard fan '' of The Doors , though I do appreciate their work . I do believe that all the actors who play the band-members do a superb job . . . But my positive comments stop there . The director , Oliver Stone , fills this movie with so many drug-induced hallucinations , you can not tell if a scene is something that actually happened or if it 's the work of Morrison 's drugged-up imagination . Now , I do n't like your run-of-the-mill biopic , but this unconventional biopic wallows in self-indulgence to the point of absurdity . Stone and the producers seem so determined to make this more of an `` art film '' than an actual biopic , and , boy , does it back-fire . Granted , every biopic is `` Hollywood-ized '' , but this movie makes you wonder way too many times where the artistic license ends and the actual facts begin or vice-versa . In short , this production showcases the leader of a rock-band - Jim Morrison - who is bent on self-destruction . The same could be said about this movie .",m,0
"Myself , being a huge doors fan , I absolutely love this movie . Oliver Stone did a great job capturing Jim Morrison 's wild life fueled by drugs and alcohol onto the big screen , but maybe he gave us a false perception of the Lizard King . Many people watch this movie to get an idea on what Jim was like , and this movie is not what it 's for . Oliver Stone exaggerated a lot of thing in Jim 's life to make it more movie like , which is completely okay , but people must understand this . As a movie , it 's fantastic , and keeps us pulled into Jim 's story throughout the whole thing , but do n't look at this movie as a documentary .",m,1
"This is the best rock movie ever made . Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time . This is a film he gets less credit for , but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done . First of all , he nails the life of Jim Morrison , the story of The Doors , and the L . A . Scene 1960s as perfectly as it can be done . It is beyond nostalgoia , it is time travel . < p > As great as Stone 's use of Doors songs , scenery , drug use and beautiful , heavily-decorated '60s California girls is , it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest . Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks . < p > Next on the agenda , you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on , irritating Ray Manzarek . To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors , everything is flawless . The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene , particularly Morrison urinating at Barney 's Beanery , which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe . < p > The feeling watching & quot ; The Doors & quot ; switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led , and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it . < p > Love my girl ! < p > STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF & quot ; BARRY BONDS : BASEBALL 'S SUPERMAN & quot ; . . .",m,1
"I must say Oliver Stone and his company did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the late 1960s . The film looks like a sixties movie . Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for the role of Jim Morrison . Though some of it was rather exagerrated , like the scene where the band performs on The Ed Sullivan Show . Ed had forbid Jim to say & quot ; higher & quot ; in the song Light My Fire , and Jim said it with an emphasized expression . I 've got the actual episode of The Ed Sullivan Show taped . The real Jim did disobeye Ed by saying & quot ; higher & quot ; , but without the emphasized expression . Meg Ryan does a good portrayal of Pamela Courson too .",m,1
"Oliver Stone has a creative imagination and uses it well in this biography of the legendary '60 's rock band & quot ; The Doors & quot ; . Unfortunately , Stone forgets that most of the people portrayed in this movie are still very much alive and have a much better memory than he does ! The music is fantastic , Val Kilmer is pretty good as the legendary Jim Morrison a little too pretty maybe as Morrison always looked a little rough around the edges ! but I hope nobody leaves this movie thinking this is how it was . Buy & quot ; The Doors : VH1 Storytellers & quot ; to get a hint of what this band was about !",m,0
"What can I say about `` The Doors '' that has n't been said already . First of all Val Kilmer was so good in this movie that when I hear a Door 's song I picture him instead of Jim Morrison . I wished I was born in the 50 's so I could have seen The Doors . Oliver Stone dipicts Morrison as a poet trapped in a rock star 's body . The epic rise and fall of the Doors is great but sad at the same time . They had so much more to offer us . Remember people the Doors were only around for 5 years . Until Morrison 's untimely death . The rest of the Doors are protrayed as innocent bystanders . John Densmore was pissing me off with his constent whining and crying . Robby Krieger was a cool guy , and Ray Manzarek was supercool . All these guys look like people that could have gone to high school with . The film has a nostaglic feeling to it , almost as if is a dockumentary rather than a film . Every time I see `` The Doors '' it feels as if its the first time .",m,1
"I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job , the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim , to an older one , was unreal . Meg Ryan also great in this . The music , acting , the story was very entertaining , this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time . < p > Great Job Kilmer !",f,1
"I think some of the people who wrote some of these other reviews may have had some pretty high expectations of what the film would accomplish . No , it does n't definitively depict the life and times of the band . Yes , it focuses primarily on the self-destruction of James D . Morrison . Yes , it 's one-sided blame the Coursons for that . So what ? Get it for the concert scenes alone , and Val Kilmer 's ininmitable performance as Morrison . I 'd recommend reading & quot ; Riders on the Storm & quot ; by drummer John Densmore either before or after seeing the film to get an idea of what Oliver Stone was getting at and also to appreciate the cameo appearances by the likes of Patricia Kenealy and Densmore himself as & quot ; Last Session Sound Engineer & quot ; . Bets of all , get one of the concert videos and check out the real deal .",m,1
"Along with The Crow , and Fight Club , this film would stand as one of my all time favourites . I have read many a novel on Jim , and own all of his albums , hence I could be a little biased on the actual filming merit of the movie , however to me , it is a striking portrayal of perhaps one of the most chrismatic and interesting artists of history . One of the main themes of the movie , and something that remains unknown to many of the band fans , is that Jim was really a poet seen by his great spoken album American Prayer , not a rockstar , and this is a contributing factor to his eventual downfall , his need to play the part of a singer . This film can be confrontingly vivid and somewhat shocking , and although it does contain several untruths regarding the events that surrounded Jim , I believe it is an excellent portrayal of his personality . Many would disagree , however few could argue that the those that hate Jim and the Doors with a passion , after seeing this film , would be slightly entrigued about Jim Morrison .",f,1
"The Doors is with out a shadow of a doubt the greatest rock and roll film ever made ! It tells perfectly what the late-great Jim Morrison went through and how he lived . This goes into the music and the L . A . scene in the late 1960 's . Everything you ever heard about The Doors or Jim Morrison comes across in this movie . The Plot is very east to understand . You find yourself felling bad for Jim because of all the stuff he put himself through , but you also feel bad for the Band because Jim made it to wear Robby , John , and Ray couldnt play their music live because of Jims on stage anticks . I found my self hating Jims wife because if he wouldnt have met her he woulndt have done half of the stuff he did , so was really a bad influence . This is a whats gon na happen next film , and Val Kilmer pulls of the roll flawlessly",m,1
"The Doors is one of music 's most enduring rock groups , led by one of the 20th century 's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison . The movie , directed by Oliver Stone , is not a biopic , more of an `` homage '' to the life , and the character of Jim Morrison . The movie details his life , and his rise and fall in music , culminating in his death at 27 . The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition , including Oliver Stone 's commentary . Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes . Highly recommended .",m,1
"I think this is a great movie . They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything . One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life . For instance , when the doors appeared on cbs , they were asked not to sing the line `` girl we couldnt get much higher '' . As most know , Jim sung it anyway , but it was an accident . Stone made it appear as it was on purpose . Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim , ehich was not true",m,1
"Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison . The name Val Kilmer is , or should be , synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing , but immensely fun and commanding . You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture . Here , he IS The Doors : The Movie . There , he WAS Wonderland . I am exaggerating , i suppose . For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you 've experienced what the sixties were like . Through using The Doors actual music what was missing from the recent Sylvia , the art of the subject itself - her poetry to help tell its story and colour its scenes , and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison , Stone really takes you into the world of his movie , and the world of the sixties . < p > This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were , and has actually cultivated love in me for their music . I did n't realise they had more than one classic : Light my Fire , The End , People are Strange , Love her Madly , Break on Through to the Other Side , Riders on the Storm , Touch Me , Roadhouse Blues Let it roll , baby roll and probably more i 'm yet to discover . < p > For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol 's factory actually felt like , see I Shot Andy Warhol . Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in & quot ; I Shot , & quot ; but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy 's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation . This , however , is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole . < p > Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo : a young film student , Jim Morrison , shows his short film to his class , who are uncouth and disparaging about it , after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn , obviously , playing the film professor , who says : & quot ; Why do n't we ask the author what he thinks ? & quot ;",m,1

It would be much better to only watch 2 or 3 target lessons , discussing concepts during or after .",f,1
"Finally , every one of the Schoolhouse Rock -- as well as a few I do n't remember .",m,1
"The reason people read a review is usually to help decide whether to buy a product . do n't waste your time , just buy this disk . it is simply the best collection of musical animated shorts ever created . the melodies , lyrics and images are so clever , profound and yet enjoyably simple that they will awe you with their beauty . for those of us who enjoyed schoolhouse rock in our chilhood , every song will spark a fond memory . for those who have n't had the pleasure unfortunately , and to the great detriment of the current generation , schoolhouse rock seems to have been shoved aside by such puerile revenue generators as hawking merchandising spinoffs from the latest pop culture garbage trend , you will be amazed at the quality , catchiness and intelligence of these productions . < p > when i got the disk , i picked the american series and was immediately enraptured by `` no more kings '' . its a beautiful , clever and funny encapsulation of our rebellion from british rule . kids will love it for the funny scens , adults will appreciate the content , and everyone will like the music . i could n't help but marvel how much better it was than the random quicks we 've been playing for our child . and this was only the first song of one of the many different groups ! the series covers grammar it 's still the way i remember parts of speech , multiplication tables , american governmental principles , science and money . schoolhouse rock won an emmy in 1978 and it probably deserved a few more - it is truly in a class by itself .",m,1
"I also grew up on Schoolhouse Rock . I was more looking forward to the Schoolhouse Rock segments than the other cartoons ! ! My most memorable thought is big number 30 , the football player , on `` Three is a magic number '' crashing through the wall . Now that I have sons of my own , I wanted to get them something educational that will teach them math , science , grammer , and history . I want them to learn about those things without realizing they were learning and have fun doing it . Schoolhouse Rock is definitely the way to go ! ! Thank God the DVD is finally coming out with all my favorites on one disk . `` A man and a woman had a little baby , yes they did . . . . ``",m,1
"I always wondered what happened to the episodes of Schoolhouse Rock . I remember waking up on a Saturday morning and singing along . Not really knowing that I was learning . Schoolhouse Rock has been a great learning exprience for myself and my brother and sister . Even though I have no children of my own , I bought this product for a friend of mine grandson . He is only two years old , she tells me that he already knows that song to Conjunction Junction . My all time favorite is The Bill . That song help me pass the constitution in the eight grade . I had to remember what the bill was for on the test . Not to Toot my own horn but I aced the test . So if anyone who isnt entirely convenced in buying this product . Do so it will help your children out alot . And the good thing about it is that they wont even know that they are learning until it is to late .",f,1
"An absolute must for anyone with small children . Covers basic math and grammar as well as science and history , all delivered in musical jingles that are easy to remember for children . The only negative about this collection is that for some reason the volume level is extremely low , probably either poorly mastered from the original source or a poor conversion from the original mono broadcast . Even with the poor sound quality this gets four stars , fix the audio and it would get 10 stars .",f,1
"Whether you are buying this for yourself to reminisce about times gone by or you are going to use it as a teaching tool I 'm using it for both as I 'm in my late 30s & grew up on School House Rock , this DVD will not disappoint .",f,1
Just what I wanted watched it with my daughter and she is already singing the songs I am sure she will learn from this dvd,f,1
"My husband and I were given this set as a gift when our sons were 4 and 2 , and I think we have had more fun with it than the kids have . I remember watching these growing up in the 80s and it 's amazing how many things I learned that stuck with me through the years . We love every minute spent watching these . My kids are starting to watch them and ask about the things they 're learning . Good stuff !",f,1
This is the best set of short educational cartoons ever made . I 've never seen a child not be memorized by them . Buy this,m,1
This DVD is a great blast from the past ! ! I grew up with these videos in the 1970 's and I forgot how funny and generally educational these videos were . It 's great to see them all again whenever I want . How wacked is the video about the U . S . spreading to the west coast because we needed `` elbow room '' ? I do n't think the Native People would appreciate that one . I was disappointed in the extras . Otherwise awesome ! !,f,1
I ENJOYED SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK growing up . I still remember the songs today at 43 ! I thought the catchy tunes would help her with multiplication . She has been listening to the whole thing over and over . I enjoy revisiting the songs too . This is a great tool to add to your arsenal to make learning fun .,f,1
"This DVD is in excellent condition and my children love it , not to mention the memories it brings back . Schoolhouse Rock should still be run on regular TV .",m,1
"My daughter 9 years old loves this video and we now share this common connection . I 'm one of the millions who grew up with these educational music videos . I 'm glad that I have the chance to share with the next generation . One minor issue with the video is the difference in sound level between the Disney advertisements at the beginning loud ! and the part of the disc you really want to see much softer . Other than that , the sound and video production is fine .",m,1
"This DVD is phenomenal . My sons love it . They used to play Schoolhouse Rock on ABC every Saturday morning in between the Saturday morning cartoons . As a kid , ABC educated us without us knowing it . The basic rules of grammar , math and U . S . history that I learned from Schoolhouse Rock , I was able to use in school . Children nowadays need more of this and less violence . Schoolhouse Rock can be incorporated in elementary school education .",m,1
I bought 2 of these one for me to keep and one for my family and it is everything i had wanted . I was skeptical cause i wasnt sure if it had every skit but it does and ones i hadnt even seen before . It was well worth the money,f,1
"Review of School House RockWhat a delightful way for children to learn ! Who does n't learn better when information is put to music . The multiplication rock section is fantastic , not only because the child can learn through music , but the songs are the kind that stay in your head all day . My grandson 's school uses this DVD to teach every subject . My son reminds me this was on tape when he was in elementary school , so it has been around for years . Enjoy !",f,1
I live overseas . I keep buying this for myself and then I 'd give it to a family with young children as a means to assist them with learning English . It is a learning tool and entertaining as well . I like that it has a variety of American subcultures represented throughout the different presentations . I think I 'll stock a few extra for gifts to my neighbors .,m,1
"These short segments that where done on American History are an excellent tool for teaching concepts about American Government that most people have no understanding . As a college professor I have used this series to teach my students about the Constitution , principles on how our government works and the history of our country , Schoolhouse Rock is more relevent today then it was 30 years ago . The princples it teaches has been lost by many Americans . My students juniors and seniors at the college leave can not answer basic question about their governmnet and how it works until they are shown Schoolhouse Rock . I show these programs every semster in order to give my students a sense of how and why things occur in the their countries covernment . I have gotten other colleaques at the college and high school level to use this series . One of my colleagues an English teacher loves the vignettes on grammer and punctuation . This series is no longer a series for children but a teaching aid for all levels of students .",m,1
"I bought this because I recalled it fondly from my childhood and figured the lessons it taught are still applicable , therefore I might actually re learn somethings . I also thought my two-year old might , just might , like bits of it . Was I wrong . He absolutely loves it and is beginning to repeat the lyrics . I strongly recommend this to all .",m,1
Had a great time watching the Grammar Rock DVD at the dentist 's office . ALL of the hygenists came in asking what we were watching while having my teeth cleaned . Everyone knew them and told which ones were their favorites I 'm Just a Bill and Conjunction Junction . My kids are grown so this video was for me . One of the other ladies at work also bought one . They are great for nostalgia ! Get them and you can be smarter than a 5th grader !,f,1
"I have fond memories of watching this series on ABC 's Saturday Morning lineup as a child during the early 1980s . I wish that ABC would resurrect the series , as I think that it makes otherwise bland academic subjects fun and engaging . Given the questionable state of culture and education in our nation today , I think that Schoolhouse Rock looks better and better .",m,1
"This is a wonderful learning tool for children or anyone who needs a refresher on the basics . I was already a teenager when Schoolhouse Rock started but whenever I need to recall my grammer I can still hear `` Conjunction , junction '' in my head thirty years later ! Now my children are finding it just as useful . Great tool !",f,1
"I learned the preamble of the Constitution when I was young listening to Schoolhouse Rock . My boys are ages 5 and almost 9 and they are learning about nouns , conjunctions , electricity , history and algebra . They love the songs and cartoon characters . Very educational , but very cute ! Wonderfully fun way to learn .",f,1
The DVD is great . It has all of the old songs and cartoons you remember from Saturday mornings as a kid . I 'm a teacher and I 've been using it in my classroom as an extension of lessons . I 'm getting a whole new generation hooked on the songs . . . `` Conjunction junction what 's your function ? ``,m,1
"I remember watching these as mini-commercials between different Saturday morning cartoons . Funny how some 30 years later , certain favorites are still in the old brain . I found myself singing along with `` Conjunction , Junction '' and `` I 'm Just a Bill '' and going down memory lane as others played . My little ones are just as in love with these as I was at their age . . . and it 's so much nicer than watching `` another DVD '' . Absolutely recommend this set ! ! ! !",f,1
I not only bought this video for my kids and kids of friends but also for some of my adult friends . It 's not only educational it 's also so much fun to watch . It sure brings back memories of my Saturday mornings as a kid . Kids today are missing out !,f,1
"My daughter and I have really enjoyed this DVD . It is a bit confusing to get to the `` play all '' function , but it is there and will play in order or shuffled . You can also choose to play all the rocks in a particular category . Her favorite is Tyrannosaurus Debt which was not even playing when I first watched these as a youngster . This is an awesome DVD to have when I need 20 minutes to cook dinner or feed the baby and want the older child occupied with `` intelligent '' TV . Excellent purchase !",f,1
"I gave this to my wife , who is a history teacher , for Christmas and we decided to pop it in the DVD player to check it out . It was amazing , how the memories flooded back . Everyone in the family recalled their favorite Shoolhouse Rock ! song and would n't let us take the DVD out until it was played ! Sometimes , more than once . Even if you remember just one of these songs from your childhood , this DVD is worth every penny .",m,1
"I love Schoolhouse Rock . . . In the late 70s early80s -- I used to wait for the commercials during Saturday morning cartoons for this . . . and when I started to watch the Smurfs on NBC -- I would switch over to ABC at 9:30 , 10 , 10:30 . . . to catch my Schoolhouse Rock . . . . now I 'll have them forever . Clever , witty , spunky , and fun . . . you have to love them . Ca n't wait to use the songs to teach more students about history , grammar , math , and everything . . . . Way to go !",m,1
"Years ago , I used to watch Schoolhouse Rock with my children and recommended it to my students as well . Today , it is entertaining and educating the next generation of our family 's youngsters . The Special 30th Anniversary Edition will be a treasure that parents and grandparents can enjoy with the kids . It 's money well-spent !",f,1
"If you are e member of Generation X and watched Saturday morning cartons , you have surely seen Schoolhouse Rock . I never realized there were 40+ of these in all . They are all great and teach math , science , history , grammar and other topics . You can watch them individually or in their subject groupings . A master `` play all '' function seems to be missing . They did a great job transferring the 30 year old animation to DVD . Everything is very clear . Great for a youngster discovering these for the first time , or a Generation Xer bringing back memories of Saturday morning cartoons .",m,1
"I just ca n't say enough about this DVD . . . it takes me back to when I was a kid watching cartoons on Saturday mornings . I think this is great not only for kids in grade school , but for adults like me who want to watch it for pure enjoyment sake !",f,1
Everyone knows how great Schoolhouse Rock is . This is my second purchase of the Aniversary Edition . We used it so much that we wore it out . These are a must have to keep in the van or car . We make the most of travel time . There is definitely a market for Educational DVD 's for use in the van ! The kids are captive and they do not know they are learning . Rock and Learn are also a must have ! Please somebody . . . . . keep them coming !,f,1
"I only wanted to add that contrary to what one reviewer wrote , this product does have a `` play all '' feature . It 's under the title `` The Whole Enchilada '' .",m,1
"When my children were young , they loved School House Rock . We sang Conjunction Junction . They never forgot the important concepts in grammar , math , social studies , and science . I boutght the DVD for my grandchildren , ages 3 to 12 A whole new generation loved School House Rock . What a great gift for grandkids .",f,1
This is a great DVD to own in a collection of family entertainment ! It brings back the memories to my Junior High days in the early 70 's just watching this on Saturday mornings ! About 30 years later it 's still entertaining and yet you yearn for more of this ! Still educational as well ! A+ all the way !,m,1
"Still the undisputed king of educational videos . At 43 years old , I can still remember the words to all these songs .",f,1
"I cherish these cartoons from my childhood . I have bought two copies and intend to buy more for family and friends . If you have children these DVDs are a great value . Their educational value makes them priceless . Some songs are better than others , but overall this is just a great concept . My neices , age 5 , watches the DVD everyday .",m,1
My 8 yr old and my 11 yr old sat side by side for hours watching the same DVD over and over and over again . What bargain ! And what happened ? They learned something too ; more then they learned from watching SPIDERMAN and Monsters Inc .,m,1
"I homeschool both my girls so I bought this video to help my girls have a fun way to learn . They just love the songs ! ! ! My six year old runs around singing `` Conjunction Junction , what 's your function ? `` My eight year old loves the history videos . I would recommend this video to everyone , whether you homeschool or not . It 's a great educational video .",m,1
"I love this DVD ! I grew up in front of the television with my cup of Captain Crunch and watching Schoolhouse Rock every Saturday morning . I remember more about basic mathematics , grammar and history from this series than from my elementary school classes . I can still sing the Preamble to the United States Constitution , `` Figure Eight '' , `` Conjunction Junction '' and `` I 'm Just a Bill '' more than 30 years later . It 's a timeless educational classic for those of us who grew up in the '70s and for the generations that have followed !",f,1
"I just met Bob heard him play these songs at a coffee shop in the Colorado mountains 3 is a magic number , bill and conjunction junction . It was an amazing trip down my childhood and I 'm now ordering the DVD .",m,1
"I used to look forward to these shorts more than the cartoon that were aired around them . These informative shorts were hip and fun for my generation and I dare say still hold up . This dvd is loaded with extras and great interactive menus with hidden features , keep your eyes open . It even contains modern artists interpretions of some of these songs some excellent renditions and fun videos . Do yourself a favor and buy this for the child inside and the children you have now ! !",m,1
"Revisiting these snippets from my childhood was incredible ! I can remember a time when just seeing `` Interjection '' would mean that I had a great weekend . Now I can have a good weekend every weekend . I 've spent the past three days engrossed in the DVDs . The animation may be of a lower quality than we 've become used to , but the lyrics and music are incredible . I have n't been able to stop singing `` Sufferin ' til Suffrage '' and `` Rufus Xavier Sasparilla '' . I recieved the DVDs as a gift and a dozen of us sat down during a party and watched these wonderful animated gems . Share them with your kids , your parents , your students , and DEFINITELY your friends . Entertaining , energetic , and educational we all need a brush up now and then , do n't we ?",m,1
"This DVD is great . To be able to go back and see all of the oldSchool House Rock videos was really cool . I now have a little girl of my own and I want her to be able to learn grammer , history , math and science in a fun way like I was able to do 30 years ago . The songs and video hold up as well today as it did 30 years ago and my daughter loves to watch and dance to the music . I recomend this to all parents and people who just want to walk down memory lane , you 'll find your self sing conjunction junction and I 'm just a bill in the shower .",m,1
"Without a doubt one of the best Saturday morning cartoons even produced and the best way to learn about grammar , history and politics . How many times have you ever found yourself saying `` I 'm just a Bill '' or `` Conjunction Junction '' , in most crowds you will get a smile and maybe even a sing along on those crafty and informative tunes . < p > This DVD offers all of the popular songs with special emphasis on what many fans votes were the Top 10 . There is also a new song featuring a voter booth named Boothy who sings about the importance of voting . The menus are fun and easy to click through . The only beef I had are the idiotic and unnecessary Disney commercials placed on the disk , you cant skip them easily and they are annoying ! Otherwise this is a most welcome addition to my DVD library and will be a prized for some time .",m,1
"Back in the 70s , I learned a lot about grammar , math and the Constitution from these short cartoons . Watching them again after 30 years , they are compact and entertaining miracles , combining catchy tunes with a surprisingly large amount of information . I plan to give a number of these as Christmas gifts to people with children . Leave your kids in front of the TV with this DVD , and they will likely surprise you with how fast they pick this stuff up .",m,1
"When I saw that Schoolhouse Rock was coming out on DVD , I was immediately taken back to 7th grade American History when our teacher asked if anyone knew the Preamble to the Constitution . I raised my hand and stood up and recited the entire thing . My teacher was very impressed and said that I had it down perfectly , except that it was n't actually a song . That was news to me ! As a mother I thought back on that day and realized the educational value of these little songs that pack so much important information , and I just had to treat my kids to the fun .",f,1
"In this captivating collection of Schoolhouse Rock ! you get all the old favorites ranging from My Hero , Zero to Little Twelvetoes . There are also great grammar numbers like Conjuntion Junction and Lolly , Lolly , Lolly , Get Your Adverbs Here , as well as mini civics lessons such as I 'm Just A Bill and a new one on the electoral college , I 'm Gon na Send Your Vote To College , which adults could learn a little about as well . Bob Dorough composed and sang many of the songs , but you also hear Blossom Dearie and The Lemonheads among others . Of course what makes this collection special is that you have all the animated pieces to go along with the songs , which provided valuable fillers between Saturday morning cartoons all those years ago . Too bad The Cartoon Channel did n't pick up on these animated classics , instead of Disney , as it would make the viewing experience a little less mind-numbing for children . So , I bought this collection to fill in the gaps .",m,1
"All the favorites that you remember , plus more - they make learning fun !",f,1
My children grew up with Schoolhouse Rock and now my grandchildren can learn from the same fun and educational songs . I still remember the words to some of the songs . Do n't pass this by it is something you and your children will enjoy and learn from !,f,1
"While I 'm sure the core audience for this material is elementary aged , my daughter age 3 absolutely LOVES Schoolhouse Rock ! and has for quite a while . While the finer points of the material are undoubtedly lost on her she can not read , after all she still gets the gist of much of it and has her favorites . Besides , the material is at least as interesting as Mazzie , Dora , the Wiggles , etc for a child of this age : the animation is quite good , the content wholesome , and the songs are both entertaining and memorable . And there are some very teachable moments as well . `` Gravity '' is a good opportunity for discussion about being careful not to fall or drop things . `` Telegraph Line '' is an opportunity for talking about pain and staying away from hot stoves . I highly recommend this for kid of all ages , 3 to 93 .",m,1
"Saturday Mornings . . . . Cartoons were on that were n't just half-hour advertisements for toys . Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera ruled the airwaves during the morning hours . Sneaking in now and then were live-action classics from Sid and Marty Krofft . And between shows , if you were on the right channel at the right time , were these quirky little musical cartoons . They had catchy tunes , and kept us glued to the TV between shows . And they educated . They actually taught us things . Things we could use later in school , and throughout life . Basics of grammar , mathematics , history , science , civics and more , all in 3-minute chunks . Now , Saturdays are cultural wastelands , `` educational TV '' is mostly unheard of outside of PBS because e i rules do n't apply to cable , and the only cartoons that do n't exist solely to sell toys are adult-oriented . Thankfully , with this DVD set , we can return to the glory days of Saturday Mornings , and share the experience with a new generation . Remember , it 's great to learn , 'cause knowledge is power !",m,1
Bought this because I was still singing the songs in my 40s and my daughter had been assigned to watch School House Rocks Conjunctions for homework . They helped her and was fun for both of us .,m,1
"I loved School House Rock growing up . It was so neat to see these again . I am almost certain they are all here . We just received this Friday afternoon , and I popped this in with other cartoon 'oldies ' yesterday morning .",f,1
"Our whole family loves this DVD . It 's a great tool to learning the basics . From the preamble , to the westward expansion to `` Where the Money Goes , `` this is a great selection of videos to have on the shelf . Everyone will love it . Catchy tunes and great info !",f,1
"School House Rock is timeless ! As a father of 5 children I see ever increasing holes in our education . The students are learning more at a greater pace and earlier in their lives . They truly are receiving a great education . However , I get the sense that some material is grazed over or skipped . School House rock is a fantastic way to give your children and the adults in your life reinforcement in the basics of education . Strengthen their educational foundation by putting this DVD in your player and letting it loop when the TV is not in use . The children will hear it , will stop and watch , and will absorb the information . I give this a high recommendation !",m,1
