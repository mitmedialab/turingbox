"Synopsis : On the daily trek from Juarez , Mexico to El Paso , Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert . Investigative reporter Karina Danes Minnie Driver arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth . Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela Ana Claudia Talancon survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue . Her story is further enhanced when the `` Wounds of Christ '' stigmata appear in her palms . She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area . Critique : Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism , miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata , I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez ' . The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns , the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U . S . Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population . I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds . `Virgin of Juarez ' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again , but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing . Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela . Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen Braveheart .",m,0
"THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez , Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso , Texas . The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light , but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director . Karina Danes Minnie Driver is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple in the hundreds killings of young women . The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work , raped , beaten and killed . Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies , in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US . She meets Father Herrera Esai Morales and a community activist Patrick Angus MacFadyen and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder , discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela Ana Claudia Talanc & oacute ; n , a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary . A father of one of the victims , Isidro Jorge Cervera , Jr . nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital , placing her in a 'church ' where she becomes a 'saint ' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end . Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims ' families . Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators , taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men ' from the police office of Detective Lauro Jacob Vargas , and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez . Fearing for Mariela 's life , they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story . The squeaky , mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson . Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism , the story would possibly have been better related . There are some good performances by Driver , Talanc & oacute ; n , Morales , and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality . Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema . It is sad when script and the production dull the impact .

"Mexican men are macho rapists , gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats . Mexican women are semi-pagan , pious fools . There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy , culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter . The story is absurd , the characters are unbelievable , the stereotypes are offensive .",m,0
"Over the past few years , public television has put on a series of vintage & quot ; Doo Wop & quot ; and Rock 'N ' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless . This latest dvd & quot ; Rock , Rhythm And & quot ; Doo Wop & quot ; , is a total delight to ones ears . Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era , when vocal talent was essential , to get a recording contract ? They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology , which enables many modern day artist 's with limited ability to survive ? This dvd reads like a who 's who of early rock . The architect of rock , Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of & quot ; Keep-A Rockin & quot ; , and the line-up that follows , keeps this concert at a premium level of performances . You get to see and hear Lou Christie , Little Anthony and the Imperials , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Joey Dee and the Starliters , Frankie Valli , Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours , just to name a few . However , nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans ? After singing & quot ; This Magic Moment & quot ; , Jay gave a performance , that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again . As he prepared to sing & quot ; Cara Mia & quot ; , he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25 , and must now at age 62 , hit those same notes ? Hit those notes he did ! Using that opera trained voice , he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it 's feet , showering him with a well deserved standing ovation . If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50 's and 60 's , this is an absolute must have dvd . I highly recommend this to everyone , who enjoys those golden oldies .",m,1
"I recvd this video DVD version as a Christmas gift . I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like , and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning . It 's the best `` Oldies '' video I 've ever seen . It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60 's , and they 're still great - Jay and the Americans , Lou Christie , The Five Satins , Little Richard , Kathy Young , Little Anthony , The Fleetwoods , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts . These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing , and it all shows . It 's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh , PA , and distributed around the country to donors . They mention that this was the third concert , and I want ALL of them . Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced . The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect , and truly celebrates their works . The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews .",m,1
"I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs , and was anxiously waiting for Rock , Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive . From the first video , which featured the cr & egrave ; me de la cr & egrave ; me of the 50s groups , to Doo Wop 51 , it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production . Better lighting , better stage layout , and better sound quality . Sadly , in terms of editing , they went overboard this time . Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me . There are times where you can hardly hear the singing , because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud . Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater . It 's simply too artificial . We want not only the authentic groups , but also the authentic reaction from who was there . And believe me , we do n't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups . For whoever edited the show , I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups . Is this DVD worth buying ? Definately , because groups singers Fred Parris & amp ; The Satins , Little Anthony & amp ; The Imperials , Little Richard , The Limelites , Jerry Butler , Lloyd Price , Bobby Lewis , and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile . I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this , they 're a wonderful experience for all ages .",m,1
Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD 's you will ever see . It is done with class and a great respect for the talent . Congratulations to T . J . Lubinsky the producer . Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today . the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on & quot ; Two Kinds of People In The World & quot ; is worth the price alone . I have played this piece over and over . All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through .,m,1
The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all ! It is just great ! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there . After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51 . What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past ! You will never regret buying this DVD .,m,1
"I have all of the doo wop DVD 's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones . Remember once these performers are gone , we 'll never get to see them again . Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you 'll LOVE this DVD ! !",m,1
"well , this just goes to show why you do n't blindly accept a critics review . I own a yellow lab 2 and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic . Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack would have been fatal if not for yellows actions . It is a very heartwarming story without being predictable and just fantastic views . The heck with critics . Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing .",m,1
"You do n't have to be a kid to enjoy this film . This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy . It has something for everyone . Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama . A few scary moments for the young ones , but nothing they ca n't handle . A few sprinkles of romance . Lots of dog-boy bonding . The ending is predictable for all but the very young , but delightful nonetheless . Best of all , it 's just a delightful movie free of violence , car chases , shoot-outs and antagonists ! This movie was engaging from start to finish . On par with < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000065V3A '' > The Journey of Natty Gann < a > and < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B00006ZXSI '' > A Walk in the Clouds < a > .",m,1

This is a fantastic movie for the whole family . The scenery was incredible in the movie .,m,1
"My family loved this adventure , especially my boys , 7 & 8 . We laughed , we cried , it became a part of us . . . . ;",m,1
"The movie still amazes and touches me even seeing it for the 3rd time . I want to see this movie everytime i remember my dog , Huck Finn - i can say he is also a yellow dog . The actors are great . The pictures are all natural .",m,1
"Growing up in the Pacific Northwest , young Angus McCormick Jesse Bradford has learned many survival skills . He 's just finishing up a nice canoe . And when he finds a stray dog , he adopts him and names him Yellow . Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad , John Bruce Davison , on a supply run seems like a dream come true . But when they encounter a fierce storm , the boat they are in capsizes . John is quickly rescued , but the search and rescue teams ca n't find any trace of Angus or Yellow . The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization . Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family ? This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare . It is a little slow at times , especially in the beginning while things are set up . It is fairly predictable . But it is entertaining . Kids will enjoy it more than their parents . My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes . Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly , never giving any plot point time to be fully developed . At the same time , I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying . The film could have been much better but does grow on you . Do n't rush out to see it , but there 's no reason to avoid it either .",m,0
Our family really enjoys this movie . The story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job . Beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged . Should be on DVD . We 'll add it to our collection .,m,1
I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out . It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion . Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending of Course . I am Disney 's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others . P . S . I am a Grandmother to eleven . Thank heavens for Disney Movies .,f,1
"I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film . Unfortunately I did n't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers . Ca n't quite put my finger on it , but perhaps I did n't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this . Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason ; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds . Also it seemed that they did n't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog . The movie is short ; not even 1 1 2 hours . It 's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring . The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog ca n't be rescued , but do n't worry as it has a happy ending . It 's an okay movie , but I expected a lot more . I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy like Shrek II . This is definately one mainly just for the kids . So many things that kids ca n't or should n't watch . This is one that anyone can watch , which is a big plus . Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials .",m,0
"This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen . The acting was n't good , it was very predictable , and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary . The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home , his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy . If you want predictable , watch a survival movie . What happens , almost always , is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident , they struggle to survive , they are found , and then brought home . `` Far From Home '' is no exception . As for unnecessary , the whole `` romance '' part of this movie was badly done and not needed . The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home , and all the while , the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse . Also some parts of this movie might upset young children , such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow ca n't be rescued . All in all , I would not advise anyone to see this movie ; in fact , I would warn against it .",f,0
"I wo n't claim to know all of the rappers that are contained in the movie but it is a good laugh much as `` Car 54 where are you ? `` with Rosi O is . Plus , Dennis Leary is great and `` Duff '' from MTV VJ around 1990-91 also makes a cameo . . . . . very cute ! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh . MJ",m,1
"Very good movie . And unlike many Chinese movies , it does not have a totally sad ending where everyone , especially the hero , gets killed !",m,1
"Recording with an audience of less than 1 , 000 , this DVD feels like a club recording with it 's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound . Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request ' gimmick is not original . Still , it manages to captivate . Fifteen songs one a medley of eight , five being from the last album , it 's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies . & quot ; She Keep On Coming & quot ; and & quot ; You Should Be Dancing & quot ; rock the house , while & quot ; Sacred Trust & quot ; and & quot ; How Can You Mend A Broken Heart & quot ; lull the audience into a trance . This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins ' and lots of joking around . Its surprising to hear Barry sing , & quot ; Woman In Love & quot ; , but & quot ; Nights On Broadway & quot ; is , once again , cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work . < p > This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning . & quot ; One Night Only & quot ; is a great live recording as well , but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation .",m,1
"This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous ! It was even fun listening to the request call-ins . Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live . Love those guys ! ! Also , they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts . I highly recommend this DVD !",f,1

"This is an amazing video for those who are suffering . When life hurts most , when the bottom falls out , when tragedy strikes I need to know , `` Is there still hope for me ? `` Louie answers a resounding YES .

"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for escaping from worldly work . Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out although too brief for me in historically correct detail . Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas ' book , the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits .",f,1
Great Blu-ray DVD for the price ! The graphic and sound quality is excellent . The product was received less than 7 days and was well packaged .,f,1
"Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on , use a great director , pick great locations , assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors , and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay , and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be . Adventure , mystery , romance , action sequences , character and plot development , and humor are all combined into a masterpiece . The 1 , 000 page book by Dumas is , of course , a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like . The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways . Incredibly , the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending . I ca n't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel . The screenplay is perfectly balanced . If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark , the action so blurred , the characters so poorly developed , and the plot so weak that you are n't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen , you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand . The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn . Caviezel just could n't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life . Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune , played by the late Richard Harris , and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him . Without giving any more of the plot away , let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has . Available in several formats , and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years , I definitely recommend this movie highly . Five stars .",m,1
"I should have read the book by now ! That 's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version -- the only movie version I 've seen so far . The cast is okay , though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating . The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively , and I totally understand Dantes ' sp ? desire for revenge , although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all .",f,1
The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it . The price was good and so was the delivery . Happy with the order .,m,1
Richard Harris and Guy Pearce made this movie great . All of the actors were superb and I think that the actual Chateau D'If was used . Superb in every way except not long enough .,m,1
Great movie . Saw it once and had to have it . Mail delivery was prompt .,m,1
"This is a well done movie of my favourite story to date . There 's some time spent in France and then it 's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now . Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one . This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see . Boy has girl , boy has a friend , boy has his dreams come true . . . boy doing there . . . who me Tarzan ? While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it 's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day . Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing . The sets are over the top . There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms .",m,1
"ACTION , ADVENTURE , INTRIGE , ROMANCE this movie has it all . This isJim 's finest film . . . he was better in this than the PASSION OF THE CHRIST . I have never read the book , but , I probably will now . There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists . I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly . In addition , the young man that played Jim 's son must be his brother , cousin , etc in real life because he looks just like him . The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying .",f,1

"The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years . I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try . However , both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel . He 's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous , yet calculated revenge . I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the `` bigger '' names . Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie ! In my opinion , it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far .",f,1
"Based on the Dumas story , this fabulous adventure about a naive , illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance , is well written with wit and intelligence , and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film . The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular , though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky . The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch , and adds a lot to the film . < p > The cast : Jim Caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the Dantes Count character ; believable both as the innocent Edmund and the worldly Count of Monte Cristo , with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant style . Richard Harris as the priest who mentor Dantes is marvelous ; wily and wise , it 's a perfect part for Harris , and he makes the most of it . Other standout performances come from Guy Peerce as Fernand , Michael Wincott as Armand Dorelac , the Warden of d'If , and most of all , Luis Guzman as a very funny Jacopo . < p > This is terrific family viewing , free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years . This film will feed your brain , delight your eyes , and raise your heartbeat a little with its fast-paced exploits about & quot ; kings and pawns , emperors and fools & quot ; .",f,1

"Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature ? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now . The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination . It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance , intrigue , sword fights , action . Definitely a movie to add to your collection .",f,1
"I 'll admit , I 've not read the original source novel on which this is based the only thing by Dumas I have read , is the classic 'Musketeers ' ; life is too short to read every great novel , try as one might - but having seen this film , I am determined to seek out the text . Judging the film on its own terms , I found this immensely satisfying , and though quite long 131 min , it does not drag for a second . The story itself is really quite something , and no matter how many films you have seen , or books you have read , you will be absolutely bowled over as George Bernard Shaw was by the breadth , depth , simplicity and universality of it . There are some minor faults with the film ; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted eg . Guy Pearce , an Australian who has mastered a range of accents , seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain : Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in 'Gangs of New York ' . There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion , no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with 'Barry Lyndon ' Kubrick , this is still a riveting , assured adaptation . These are very minor quibbles , and I would put this in with some of my favourite films , along with 'Captain Blood ' Errol Flynn , 'Koyanisquaatsi ' , 'New Cinema Paradiso ' and 'Celebration ' aka Festen . Generally , the script is absolutely top notch , full of little throw-away quips and putdowns . The cast is absolutely stunning , especially James Calaziel , absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger . Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate . Very highly recommended , for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock .",m,1
"A film by Kevin Reynolds < p > This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas 's classic novel `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it , but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it , I was willing to give it a chance . Good thing , because this is a pretty good movie . < p > The story , if you are not familiar with the source material , follows Edmond Dantes Jim Caviezel . Dantes , in the film , is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego Guy Pierce trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying . The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled , and while they get help , Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal , and innocent , letter to a friend . Dantes agrees . Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter , though we do see his fianc & eacute ; Mercedes Iguanada Dagmara Dominczyk and a little bit of Mondego 's jealousy . Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason . That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all . The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years . < p > This is where the movie truly begins . Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes , and he wants his revenge , though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison . While in prison , Dantes meets Abbe Faria Richard Harris , a man who is digging a tunnel slowly , inch by inch to escape . Faria trains Dantes in the sword , teaches him how to read , science , literature , politics , and how to be a noble . He also tells Dantes of a treasure , the treasure of Monte Cristo , that may or may not exist . < p > We would n't have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge , so I 'm not spoiling anything by revealing that . Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo Luis Guzman . Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge . < p > The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit , but this film is good enough , and slick enough , and entertaining enough , that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch . No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel , especially not a 1000 page novel . With the amount of time allotted this film , `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' succeeds at being an entertaining film .",m,1
"I read the 'Monte Cristo ' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it , so I was really pumped up to see it on screen . First off , the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film . BUT , I have to take points off for the ending . Whenever a book is made into a movie , the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually . My issue was not just that the ending was changed , it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book ! It was totally ridiculous ! It was exactly what you would expect to happen , even though it was totally unrealistic . That 's why I gave it only three stars . If you 're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience , it 's a wonderful film . I suggest that you read the book first , see the movie , and judge for yourself . Or if you 've already seen the film , go read the book anyway and see what you missed .",f,0
I very much enjoyed this iteration of the Count . It was well filmed and well acted . It makes a person think of what they would do if they suddenly got very rich and had blood enemies . Would you seek revenge or would you be fat and rich ? Guy Peirce gives a wonderful performance . Rent this movie you will like it and probably want to purchase it .,m,1
"This movie was truly amazing ! Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count , and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy . The cenimatography was beautiful , and while it was long , you love every minute of it . There are some well done action sequences with quickened framework that adds to the tension and the adaptation from the novel while forced to leave a lot out , obviously . . . the book is insanely long ! is far better than most works of this sort . It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore the same as Mask Of Zorro , in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out , so if you 're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere and it 's well worth your while !",m,1
Amazing movie . I saw it in a huge tv screen after hooking up my computer in my tv . The quality was amazing and the speed just perfect like a DVD .,m,1
"BEST MOVIE EVER . Love the book , love the movie . You ca n't go wrong with this classic , so I would definitely recommend it !",m,1
I have always loved this movie and now I can see it on the go ! The picture quality is awesome ! U wo n't regret gettin this movie,f,1
I rented this movie to have a small idea of what it was about because I was monitoring the homework of a 9th . grader tasked with reading the book and answering questions . It seems to have followed the book fairly closely . At least I could ask relative questions . It was well worth the rental fee .,m,1
I have watched this movie numerous times . I have always enjoyed the overall theme of this movie . I will probably watch it again .,m,1
"In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available . I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work . WRONG ! This superbly made film of the Dumas ' novel is excellent and gripping on every level . The quality of the film , shot in Ireland and Malta , is visually stunning , the story remains true to the original , and the cast is outstanding . James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role , aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce , the veteran Richard Harris , the here venomous James Frain , a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman , and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk . The movie is beautifully paced , the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport , and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well . This is a beautiful period piece , finely photographed and scored and edited and directed . For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually , treat yourself to an evening with The Count !",m,1
"This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo . It does n't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others . It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas . < p > The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes . A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit . He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If . thats not how you spell it but it 's close enough for me It 's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature , economics , and swordplay . Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail . < p > This is a great story of revenge . Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes . He does a great job . He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he 's rich . He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character . I 'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future . < p > Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego . I was first impressed with Pearce in L . A . Confidential . It 's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again . He plays a great bad guy . You ca n't stand his character and that 's because Pearce plays him so good . < p > This is an awesome tail of revenge . If your a diehard Dumas fan you wo n't like this . I 'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you . However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you . It 's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies : To Be Entertained . You 'll like this one .",m,1
"I purchased this dvd for two reasons . One , I 've read the book many times , and it is a classic . I have seen many of the other productions , and I wanted too see how this one compared . Two , I am a BIG fan of Jim Caviezel , and wanted to see his portrayal of the Count . I was not disappointed on either count ! It was timely and acting very well done . I had seen this when it first came out , but seeing Person of Interest every week , I decided to buy the Count . Great dvd fora fan !",f,1
Arrived withing the time period listed . DVD had popped loose from post inside case probably occurred during shipping and disc was slightly scratched . Played fine and have no complaints .,m,1
"I received a copy of this for my birthday , and I love it . This copy is great . The colors seem much more vivid and the sound much better . I think I could watch this over and over but never grow tired of it . Some people have complained about the movie because it does n't follow the book close enough . I agree that it does n't follow the book closely , but that should n't detract from one 's love for the movie . The full book is 1100 pages . It would be impossible to put that into a single movie . They would have to make it 3 separate films like Atlas Shrugged is being done . This one is totally worth it .",m,1
"This is a very good DVD , romantic and somewhat historical . It takes place around the time of Napolean 's exile . I have watched this many times and have shared it with teenagers , who also love it .",f,1
What is so wrong with making a movie and changing the story or plot a little . As if Dumas ' books are sacred writ . . . so many struggle to find any value in an adaptation . If you ask me this movie was far more entertaining than either the book or any of the earlier films of the same title . I enjoy a great rewrite .,m,1
"Great movie ! Enjoyable to watch and see how cleverly the hero exacts his revenge . Not as good as the book but similar . Well made , great acting , one you can watch again and again !",m,1
"This CD was very good . The view of the movie was good , and it came in a timely fashion . I really enjoyed watching this movie . Thank you .",f,1
"I really enjoyed this movie . Does not follow the book really , but thats ok because I felt the movie was better . Overall , very enjoyable .",m,1
"This was the first movie I viewed with Jim Caveizel acting . I thoroughly enjoyed the plot , writing , and acting . It is an excellent story of redemption and justice . It has long been a favorite with our Family !",m,1
"Great Movie , I had seen it years ago and wanted to see it again and it was just as good the secound time around .",f,1
"This is a great movie . My wife watches it over and over , about 7 times now .",m,1
"The movie is excellent in all respects ; however , the company , MovieMars , is not . First they sent an unusable CD due to it being the wrong Regional area . Then when I sent it back , at the expense of $ 5 . 43 mailing fees , they refused to reimburse me for the postage . They refunded the original fee for the CD , but not the postage for return fee . They claimed I should have known what Region I am in and which CD would or would not work on my machine . Well -- I have been renting , buying , and borrowing CDs for about 15 years and have never had this experience before . I believe the CD they sent was meant for foreign markets and they should have known which one to send due to my return address . Anyway -- they were nasty about it , and until I get the postage refunded to my Visa account , I will not be ordering from them , for sure , and probably not from Amazon . After all , Amazon is the company that is truly in charge here . Thank you .",f,1
"Good movie but ends differently from the book . Had I not read the book , I would have enjoyed it more . I bought the VHS used at a very good price . I was very pleased .",m,1
"You can place this in that `far better than I remembered it being ' category . `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is fun , exciting , intelligent and suspenseful , far more than I expected it to be and far better than I remembered it . Having recently indulged in this forgotten gem once again , I 'm finding myself kind of giddy . This movie is fun . If you are into the classic adventure films like `Swiss Family Robinson ' and `Robinson Caruso ' , this film is right up there and certainly just as engaging . You know , my initial dislike for this movie was probably plagued by a heavy dose of bias . My parents lauded it , and so that is usually sparks an initial reaction of discomfort . I mean , I pride myself on having better cinematic taste than they do , and so when they recommend something to me I 'm usually hesitant . Still , they saw the movie twice in the theater and encouraged me to accompany them on their THIRD trip to the movies . I begrudgingly accepted the invitation . Now , mind you , I do n't think that Guy Pearce or Jim Caviezel are great actors . Capable , yes , but no where near `great ' . I think that also clouded my appreciation for this film . I was also merely sixteen when this film was released , so I kind of have an excuse for judging films with sharp bias . Still , I did enjoy the film enough to buy it later on a whim and I 've watched it several times since then . Upon my most recent viewing I found the film elevating drastically for me . The film tells the tale of Edmond Dantes , a middleclass sailor whose friend , the wealthy Fernand Mondego , is surprisingly jealous of Edmond 's good fortune . He has recently been promoted to captain of his vessel and has become engaged to his girlfriend , the ravishing Mercedes . Spurned on by his jealousy , Fernand betrays his friend , concocting an elaborate and viscous scheme that lands Dantes imprisoned in the torturous Chateau d'If . While in prison he bonds with a fellow prisoner who teaches him to fight , as well as articulating him , teaching him to read and write and converse as a gentleman . Then he informs him of a hidden treasure and tells him the location . Once Edmond finds a means of escape he uses his newfound knowledge to create a disguise , allowing him to exact revenge on the men responsible for his loss of thirteen years in prison . With ravishing and passionate performances , stunning visual prowess and a sharply constructed script that breathes an air of believability in a premise that is undoubtedly far-fetched , `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is nothing short of grade-A entertainment and serves as further proof that first impressions are n't always correct .",m,1
Arrived quickly and excellently packaged . DVD in even better condition than description . Very happy .,f,1
"And even though the above quote is not taken from this movie , it did remind me a lot of it as I was watching this film . I could see this movie plenty of times and not get bored of it thanks to its clever script and wonderful acting by all personnel . You probably know by now what `The Count of Monte Cristo ' is all about so I will not bore you with the subject matter of the film . But what I will say is , if you enjoy seeing the enemy get no mercy -not necessarily getting killed- and thriving for vengeance at its best with witty `traps ' , then there is no exception for you to miss out on this movie .",m,1
"While this film may not make it into the `` classic '' category , I 've surely seen a lot of movies which were much , much worse . This one is colorful , well-acted , and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas ' 1200-page novel . Of course , as any screenwriter has learned , it 's not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film . Therefore , entire swathes of the novel 's plot wind up in the waste-basket , characters are blended together , and so on . The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count Edmond Dantes and Mercedes . In the novel , the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways . As I recall , Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent , while Edmond frees his `` Greek slave '' and marries her . In this movie , Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss . There is no `` Greek slave '' -- - she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff , including the lesbian runaways . I really think and hope that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson 's `` Lord of the Rings '' -- - or from the TV mini-series . Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame : they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story . Of course , that 's just me sayin ' . : - This is a good movie ! But it could have been a lot better !",m,1
One of my favorite movies of all time . James Caviezel is excellent in his role as the count . Set on revenge for a serious injustice he ends up with some good fortune that runs his way while in prison . Sets the rest of the movie to plot against the very men that caused his demise . Great Movie !,m,1
"the disk of the dvd i bought was in good condition but i waited quite a while for it to get to me , so that is my only complaint with this purchase",m,1
"having read this book in grade school , it made a huge impression on me . . . so how great to find this film three decades later and share with my daughter . thought the execution was fantastic , and the departures from the script did not bother me , though i do plan to grab a copy of the book and re-read it . highly recommended .",m,1
"My order was shipped so quickly , it was great . I received the movie with no complications which is not always true when ordering things off the internet .",f,1
I was at work when a coworker told me about this movie and that it was really good . So being the fact that I am always looking for a good movie I ordered it from my work computer . Upon watching the movie I was very happy with my dissension to buy it . Since it was old it worth more buying than renting . The movie it self is very detailed and very satisfying . The ending felt like an ending where some movies I 've seen just leave me saying That was a waste of time I would recommend this movie to anybody it has action for myself and drama the my wife really got into .,m,1
"This movie is a classic - the perfect combination of action adventure , intrigue , and romance . It 's amazing .",f,1
This addition of the famous story is mostly to be recommended . The acting is first rate and 'Mercedes ' is a knock out . The movie works very well even though it does n't follow strictly to the book . My only criticism is it 's scanty treatment of the part of the story where Dantes The Count rescues his old employer and friend from ruin by setting him up with a new replica of his original one boat . This is one of the central parts of the story and deserved more screen time than it got .,m,1
"I really appreciated this film on the second viewing . Afterwards , I thought , `` Wow , that was really a satisfying , great film to watch . `` Satisfying , of course , to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale enacted out but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through . Boy , I hope this comes out on Blu-Ray some day . Acting-wise , the most fun to watch was Richard Harris as `` Priest , `` the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel , the man Edmond Dantes unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie . Harris had some of the best lines in the movie , several very profound statements . Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in `` The Passion Of The Christ '' - sermons about believing in God ! That 's the acting profession ; one film you play an atheist , the next you are Jesus ! For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow , stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison . Shortly afterward , he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch , played by Luis Gusman , who still sounds like he 's more at home in the streets of New York but , once again , you suspend belief and just go along for the ride . Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do , but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing , making enjoyable films like this . To be fair , it is n't just revenge , as this film points out , it 's `` justice '' we all like to see . In here , the two words are interchanged , depending upon one 's rationalizations .",m,1
"One of the best Movies I have seen in many years . Jim Caviezal will become a national treasure . Up there with Morgan Freeman , Hoffman , Redford etc . If you want to see a great movie and one to add to a collection this is it . Briancleveland ohio .",m,1
"This is one of my favorite versions of the count of Monte-Cristo ! I just love James Caviezel as Edmund Dantes ; he is a beautiful , handsome man ! If you love hidden treasure , pirates and seaman , and adventure , and romance , then this movie is just for you ! I highly recommend this movie , it is a story about a poor , innocent and handsome seaman , who gets charged with a crime that he did not commit ! His rich best friend Mondego , betrays Edmund , with the help of Dangler the ships first mate they are very jealous of Edmund . Villefort , a powerful and deceitful man joins forces with Mondego , and puts Edmund in prison , and charges Edmund with crimes that he did not commit ! Mondego ends up marrying Edmunds sweetheart Mercedes , while Edmund is in prison . After several years in prison , Edmund becomes bitter and seeks revenge , and with the help of a fellow prisoner Richard Harris-the priest , Edmund learns how to read and gets a education and learns how to sword fight ! The priest helps Edmund escape , and gives him a hidden treasure . Then Edmund is rich and free ! And seeks revenge ! I just loved this movie , a definite must see movie !",f,1
"This Buena Vista film version spoken in English of the Count of Monte Cristo is a very fast-paced DVD version of Alexander Dumas 's novel of the same title . James Caviezel and Guy Pearce 's performes are both well-performed . I could imagine James Caviezel as the Count of Monte Cristo as pictured in Dumas 's novel . The remainder of the characters also fitted their roles well , especially Danglars , Villefort , and Mondego . It is true that this film version is meant to display acting , especially plot sequence . It therefore does not allow the characters time to develop the way that Dumas 's book did . However , this film does present most of the major aspects of the book that are most important to remember . The revenge sequence at the end of the film does GREATLY variate from the book . For example , Villefort is arrested , Danglars is also arrested , and Mondego dies in a duel . This is not exactly what a BBC drama afficianado might want to see , but then again , no one has ever accused Buena Vista of attempting to mimic the BBC . Overall , if you want to watch the book on DVD , I would advise you NOT to purchase this DVD . However , if you are willing to watch a film that is relatively entertaining , with good acting and well-designed sets yet not altogether loyal to Dumas , than this might be the film version for you . Otherwise , the Koch Lorber Films French version of the Count of Monte Cristo 1999 , starring Gerard Depardieu might serve your purpose better - especially if you know how to converse well in Francais French .",m,1
"This is one of my favorite movies . Granted it was only released four years ago and I 've probably seen it 4-5 times . I find , not necessarily in this order , a strong sense of fidelity to the original book . While this may seem faint praise , when you compare it to the disasters of Musketeers and Iron Mask , this film is brilliant . The movie addresses the intrigue of the time . The Bonapartists , the Republicans , and of course the Star Chamber proceedings absent witnesses and certainly absent justice . Edmund Dantes is imprisoned not for something he did but for something he knows . And the prosecuutor who sentences him conspires with Dantes ' friend to arrange a Hitchcockian 'man on the train ' exchange of murder most foul , Villafort sentencing the unknowing Dantes to life or death in Chateau d'Iff , a watery prison-grave and Mondego , lusting after Dantes ' bethrothed , Mercedes , to murder his Villafort 's father , an embarrassing Bonapartist . The movie reeks of post revolutionary Paris and you get a palpable sense of the times . Dangerous times , but times when a man of revenge and money might make his way . We feel for Dantes once he escapes from prison , on the one hand rooting for his victory while on the other , saddened by his consumption of hate . Even Mercedes asks him to relinquish his hate and he tells her , surrounded by wealth , 'it 's all I have . 'Caviezel is brilliant as the brooding wronged man , articulate and well trained by his colleague in prison , Father Faria Richard Harris , with his rage and torture so very close to the surface . Guy Pearce is excellent as the promiscuous , unscrupulous Mondego , and kudos must be given to Luis Guzman , who is always good , and Harris , who is always brilliant . You ca n't miss . 5 stars . Larry Scantlebury",m,1
Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo . I look forward to seeing this movie again .,f,1
"I must confess that I have not read the book that this movie is based on . I did enjoy the few Dumas stories I have read , though . Most people that give this movie a big thumbs down have read the book and , rather unrealistically , expect a perfect translation of a 900+ page book into a film with a run time of just over 2 hours . Obviously , that 's not going to happen . So I 'll just tackle the film itself . < p > The Count of Monte Cristo hit the theaters in early 2002 , arriving with all the fanfare of . . . well , you know when the grocery store gets a new shipment of cereal ? Less than that . But sometimes the smallest splashes result in the greatest impacts . The Count of Monte Cristo came out and reminded the few who saw it that a movie can have a great , cohesive story with superior acting and entertain without being either pretentiously arty or exceptionally lowbrow . As I said , all of the actors are great : Jim Caviezel , Guy Pearce , Richard Harris , Tom Everett Scott , Luis Guzman , Michael Wincott , etc . < p > If you 're looking for an accurate adaptation of the novel , this probably is n't your place , but if you 're looking for an entertaining , epic film with action , intrigue , betrayal , revenge , and even a dash of comedy , you ca n't do much better than The Count .",m,1
"This is a wonderful retelling of Dumas ' Count of Monte Cristo . James Caviezel plays a wonderful Edmund Dantes , and a mysterious Count Of Monte Cristo .",f,1
"We 've seen many of these revenge movies and the COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a compilation of them all . Oh , and throw in a little of the illiterate and naive country bumpkin who becomes educated by the kindly older gentleman during an undeserved incarceration and we have a great film . This movie is reminiscent of Zorro , Pirates of the Caribbean and all the good swashbucklers that we have come to enjoy . James Caviezel does an outstanding job of playing Edmund Dantes , the honorable and kindly young man who is wrongfully accused of treason by his jealous best friend . Abb ' Faria the delightful Richard Harris , another prisoner befriends Dantes during the thirteen years he is imprisoned . This priest not only educates Dante , but also gives him a map to a great treasure . When Dantes escapes he finds the treasure and then begins his quest of retaliation against those who betrayed him . We all like vengeance movies where the 'bad guy ' gets theirs and MONTE CRISTO is one of the best ! The scenery , costumes and acting are all top notch and the little love story is also highly enjoyable .",f,1
"Great flick for a Saturday night during the winter . The camera work and filmaking were excellent , Italy and France never looked so good from the sea . The actors were good , the novel was represented fairly well , and this movie moves along at a good pace . The classic themes of revenge , adultery , deceipt , redemption , father vs . son , friend vs . friend , lover vs . lover , are all in this movie . While this movie will not win a ton of awards , compared to so much of the low quality movies out there today , this movie definitely receives a grade of & quot ; B & quot ; or higher . Worth seeing .",m,0
"This most recent adaptation of the famous novel is a little slow and meandering in the first third of the movie , but following the appearance of Richard Harris - like a mole rising from the ground - the pace quickly picks up and explodes as the lead protagonist wreaks vengeance on those who betrayed him earlier . The movie is not as effective as the 1978 version which starred Richard Chamberlain in the lead role , but what it does have in evidence is some truly interesting features . My favorite extra feature on this DVD is the documentary which recounts the adaptation of the story and why the screenwriter made the changes that he did . Well recommended .",m,1
"If you have read this classic tale by Alex Dumas , you wo n't be disappointed ! This is a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up until the very end ! It will exceed your expectations , I promise you ! Jim Caviezel makes a great Dantes and Pearce 's dialogue is truly amazing . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",m,1
"I wrote a review for this DVD , but it never got posted for some reason . I gave it one star because I was under the impression that this was going to be released in FULLSCREEN only . At least , that 's what was listed on this page . But now , I look on this page and it says WIDESCREEN format . YES ! PHEW ! Okay , now I WILL buy this movie , because it is an excellent one . And looking at the special features listed , the DVD itself looks promising . < p > I will most likely write another review once I get the DVD and am able to explore the special features . Just wanted to say how glad I am to find out that the whole FULLSCREEN situation was a terrible mix up . I just hope that THIS is n't another typo .",m,1
"`` The Count of Monte Cristo '' is a lavish adaptation of the 1845 Alexander Dumas novel . The film stars Jim Caviezel as Dantes , a sailor framed for treason by his supposed best friend , Fernand Guy Pearce . But why would anyone frame his best friend for treason ? Well , poverty stricken Dantes has something rich and powerful Fernand does not ; love . Fernand wants Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk ; Dantes true love , for himself . Thus , Fernand concocts an evil setup , framing Dantes for treason . Dantes is then imprisoned on the cruel island prison of Chateau D'lf for 13 years , where he transforms from a lighthearted sailor to a bitter and angry man . While at Chateau D'lf , he plots revenge against those who betrayed him . < p > Richard Harris also puts forth a quality performance as Abb & eacute ; Faria , another innocent prisoner . With the help of this strange old man , Dantes escapes the island and transforms himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo after following an old treasure map to a load of treasure on the island of Monte Cristo thus the `` Count of Monte Cristo . Becoming rich and powerful is the first step in Dantes revenge . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' is such an enjoyable film mainly because of the sweet satisfaction involved in watching Dantes execute his revenge on Fernand . Revenge is always an exciting thing to watch ! The audience is able to identify with Dantes and sympathize with him . You may even find yourself becoming as obsessed over exacting revenge as Dantes ! My point is ; you are really drawn into the story , more so that any film in recent memory . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' brings in some intriguing aspects of Dantes personality about midway through the film . When Dantes returns as The Count of Monte Cristo , he sees that he could have a perfect life if he wanted to . His love , Mercedes , still wants to be with him and he now has all the money he could ever need . Yet Dantes pushes it all away . He must complete his revenge . It has now become clear that Dantes has become obsessed and can no longer look at the world in a rational way . It 's really quite painful to see what Dantes has become . < p > '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' boasts an intelligent screenplay , lavish sets and costumes , breathtaking cinematography , superb action sequences , beautiful music , superb directing and stellar acting .",f,1
"Classics remain beloved for hundreds of years because they are wonderfully crafted and contain universal truths that still speak to us . The director and producer of this condescending adaptation of Dumas ' classic story must feel that the modern American audience does n't have the intelligence to appreciate great classic works . Oh , the basic story line is there -- man is wronged , man goes to prison , man escapes , man finds treasure , man seeks revenge . But that is where the homage to this great work ends and the often ridiculous changes are made . I know that it is cliche to say that the movie is not as good as the book . In this case , however , I ca n't believe they actually had the audacity to call the movie by the same name as the classic novel which it so minimally follows . One can excuse some adaptations of a novel when produced as a screenplay , but the changes made in this case lose all the beauty and terrible power of the original story . Instead of a wonderful slow burn with a lot of atmosphere as Dantes slowly and painstakingly weaves a web of revenge for the wrongs done to him , we have stupid devices like a flamboyant entry in a hot air balloon , complete with Cirque du Soleil acrobats twisting on the ropes . Instead of an intricate plan to destroy the personages who wronged him , we have swashbuckling sword fights every few scenes . Some major characters are missing completely such as Valentine some have been shamelessly changed and substituted Jacopo for Ali . The final plot device is totally contrived and NOT in the book -- we find out that Dantes has a son sired on Mercedes before he was arrested . I guess the screenwriters felt they had to put some sex in the story or no one would like it . I awaited this production eagerly ; having now seen it I feel disgusted and insulted . If you want to see an intelligent production of the Count of Monte Cristo , avoid this movie like the Black Death . It would be better to lock the DVD in the Chateau D'If . If you have n't read the book , you may enjoy it , since you wo n't be dissapointed by what is lacking . It does have good scenery and filming , although some of the acting is terrible Jacopo especially . To the director and producers : for shame . Nearly everything about this movie was wrong , wrong , wrong . Give the American audience some credit for pity 's sake . We can appreciate great works just as they are .",f,0
"This movie is excellent as a movie . As far as following the book not so . However let 's be honest : If this movie were to be faithful to the book , it would be 100 hours long ! There are over 200 characters in the book , and several sub-plots that are unable to be adapted to cinema accurately . If one is a purist , do n't watch movies based on books ! You will always be disapointed . The job of someone adapting a book for Cinema , is not necessarily to reproduce the book in exact detail which in most cases is impossible unless its a tv miniseries that can run all week . It is to reproduce the essence of the story , and find those things which will make for the best film . That 's tough when you are constrained to 2-3 hours of film . The Count of Monte Christo presents the essence of Dumas ' story , a man betrayed by his best friend , learning the skills to survive in prison from a priest , also unjustly imprisoned , and returns to exact his revenge , and in the process , he learns that revenge is not worth it . The acting , costume , music , cinematagraphy and sword play is second to none , and the movie is quite entertaining . The only problem I had was that they spend a lot of time building up God , and religion and morals , then present fornication and adultery in a positive light because Dantes and Mercedes `` Loved each other '' , which as a Christian I had a problem with . Maybe that does n't bother the non-religious viewer , but it presents a contradiction to me that is at best difficult to reconcile and at worst ruins the moral impact of the movie .",m,1
"I was blown away by the incredible adaptation of a familiar tale . Jim Caveziel was hauntingly sensitive , only to turn fearfully vengeful . His nemesis , and former best friend , Guy Pearce , hinted at a carefully concealed malice before indulging in a fearsome betrayal . Everything in this film works . The sword play in this Alexandre Dumas swashbuckler is awesome . The sets , the costumes , all combine to seduce the viewer . Furthermore , the DVD extras are excellent , both informative and entertaining . I can remember Richard Chamberlain 's Count from the 70 's , I believe , and I did not expect to ever see a better one . But I was wrong . This film is better . A definite must-see , which I somehow missed when it was released .",f,1
"After seeing `` The Lord of the Rings '' 4 times in the theater I saw a preview and thought I would go see this one . First let me say that this is a wonderful movie ! At first I thought it started out a little slow , but then after a little it sped up and was a 'ca n't take your eyes off the screen ' type of movie . However , I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was expecting more action-as in swordplaying . Well actually I was expecting another `` Mask of Zorro '' movie Antonio Banderas . That was the first movie that came to my head while waiting to see `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' . But I suppose they wanted to make it for a variety of audiences instead of just for the action movie type of people . I think that they did a very good job . Like someone earlier said , this movie works on all levels . This movie is perfect for anyone . But seeing that I have never read the book I obviously do n't have an opinion on what it looks like to them . But for those of you who do n't know the plot line it is very unpredictable and exciting and worth seeing .",f,1
"While this maybe an entertainig movie for the ones who have not read the book , it is an abomination for those of us who cherish one of the world 's greatest classics . It is like Romeo and Juliette getting married and live happily ever after . There are indeed beautiful scenes , good acting and an appealing story the movie is not really reflecting the book . I was thoroughly disgusted walking out of the theater . I would very highly recommend the 1974 version with Richard Chaimberlain as a much better film",m,0
"The Count of Monte Cristo is probably one of my favorite books . Its numerous , but inter-connected plot lines are filled with suspense , romance , and `` you know you had it coming '' revenge . The movie adaptation of this novel was awful . Except for the title , character names , and a few other details , there is nothing in the movie that resembles the original . The movie only focuses on the struggle and revenge of Edmound Dantes , which turns out to be a watered down version of the book 's . No amount of fight scenes would have saved this movie . Plus , the ending is completely different ! ! ! ! I would only recommend this movie if you plan to NEVER read the book . If you have read The Count of Monte Cristo , DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE ! It will only disappoint you . Like it did me .",f,0
"I have used the DVD & quot ; The Counte Of Monte Cristo & quot ; in religion class to give the teenage students a deeper understanding about 'Sins ' and 'Virtues ' . The character of Fernand Mondego is an example of a sinful man who is filled with : pride , envy , gluttony , lust , anger , greed and sloth . On the 'virtuous ' side is the character 'Edmond Dantes ' he displays the virtues of : humility , kindness , abstinence , chastity , patience , liberality and diligence . The movie poses some great topics for the students to dialogue over and they are excited to discuss it in class . I would however , show this movie in short segments of 30 minutes . There is plenty of material to keep your class in discussions for several weeks .",f,1
"I love , love , love this movie ! The acting is superb , especially the relationship between Edmond and the priest . This movie has it all - romance , friendship , family , betrayal , murder , prison , escape , love , poverty , wealth , etc . I 've watched this at least 20 times and will watch it again someday soon .",m,1
"I 'll start off by saying that the book is one of my all-time favorites and is well worth the read . But do n't expect the movie to exactly copy the book . The book contains far too much detail and plot turns to allow it all into a movie that could be viewed in one sitting , so why even bother to try ? The movie starts with the same premise as the book , it veers off into a new and refreshing direction . While it retains the same flavor , it differs in many of the details . The result is a wonderful story , optimized for the screen , that keeps those who know the story well very entertained and not quite sure what 's coming next . Jim Caviezel 's performance in this movie is excellence in acting . He displays the misery and agony well when needed , then moves onto a focused , calculated and emotionally-repressed Count . Excellent acting in one of the most difficult roles imaginable - right up his alley . Luis Guzman 's Jacapo makes the movie . The role of the character in the movie does an excellent job of helping to `` explain '' the Count efficiently . Nearly each line that comes from Guzman 's mouth is memorable - the quality of his performance alone would have overwhelmed many lesser movies . The action , effects , score and other items that you 'd expect from Hollywood are all there - in sufficient quantity without overwhelming the viewer . It definitely should have swept the awards in 2002 ! !",m,1
This is a beautifully done rendition of theclassic . This screen adaptation is better I think than the novel . The screen version has a more cohesive plot and it has a happier ending . It is a great family movie despite the sword fights and other intense scenes of violence . There is a lot of humor and romance but there are serious lessons taught as well without being preachy . My children range from age 10 to 17 and they all love it and quote from it all the time . This recent purchase was a gift . We have gifted several copies . It is one of our favorite movies .,f,1

"The original story by Dumas is a timeless classic . For me this film is not a great adaptation . Much of the film occurs in `` Dark-o-Vision '' . . . using only natural light or candlelight . Perhaps more realistic , but frustrating for lack of details to savor , and confusion during several action sequences . There are several outdoor scenes that have radical changes in lighting . The end duel occurs in bright sunny daylight and dark cloudy weather , all in a matter of minutes . The lead character just does n't seem to have the from the gut passion he should have . Actually the leads are just quick sketches , and not allowed enough time to become more than just puppets . I think too much precious screen time in spent in the set-up . This time should have been better spent in the social educational fighting re-awakening prison training sceens , especially when you have such an interesting and fascinating actor such as Richard Harris as the instructor . The delicious machinations of revenge , and the crushing realisation when the original betrayers are destroyed are not here , to be enjoyed by us or the protagonist . When he finally during his escape `` gets even '' with the whip wielding warden it is confusing and not satisfying for us the audience . Yes , revenge is wrong , and that message is reached at the conclusion . . . but it is a major audience pleaser , `` the money shot '' and should n't be glossed over , nor ultimately condoned . The swordfights were well choreographed , but filmed in a confusing manner , and without pace . For me the only part that reached wonder was when the Count first appears , in the balloon . But even that scene is quickly ended on a flat note . This is where the storey should start to reach an exiting level , allowing us and him to revel in his new rich and glamorous lifestyle , but always with the anger simmering underneath . There is some great location photography . Wonderful costumes . Good effort , but does not do the Dumas story justice . This is just my opinion , and does not mean any more or less than any one else 's .",m,0
The movie came in quicker than I expected and I am very pleased with the results,m,1
"Best movies I have purchased . . . . betrayal , deception and the power of love . . . . wow worth the cost ***********",m,1

"This 2002 film brings the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas to the screen with a swashbuckling intensity that starts at the beginning and never lets up . It 's set in France at the beginning of the 19th Century and tells the tale of a young man , falsely imprisoned because of his friend 's betrayal , who escapes and eventually has his revenge . Of course it 's more complicated than that . There are ups and downs and twists of fate . There is swordplay and hidden treasures and pirates and secrets unfolded . And it 's all wrapped up in a package that swept me up in the story and held me captive till the end . < p > Jim Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes who has the misfortune to have Fernand Mondego , played by Guy Pearce , as a friend . When Dantes is betrayed , he is sentenced to an unlimited amount of time in a terrible prison where he lives in solitary confinement and gets whipped once a year . The years pass , his clothes grow ragged , his hair grows longer and his despondency increases . Then , one day , another prisoner , Abbe Faria , played by Richard Harris , tunnels his way into Dantes ' room . Abbe Faria is old , but he has hope . And together they plan their escape . All they have to do is spend the next eight years digging another tunnel . In the meantime , Faria teaches his young prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; to read and write . He also teaches him to use a sword . Eventually , as they make their escape , the old man dies , but not before he gives Dantes a map to hidden treasure . < p > The story now takes a different turn because the treasure that is found allows Dantes to become The Count of Monte Cristo , return to his home town and exact revenge on Fernand Mondego , who is now married to Mercedes , played by Dagmara Dominczyk , who was once Dantes ' sweetheart . < p > The acting was excellent , the cinematography outstanding and the story wonderful . And , because I saw it on DVD , the extras made the experience of watching this film even better . There 's a short history of Alexandre Dumas , who was of Caribbean heritage and one of the most prolific authors of his time . There 's a interview with the screenwriter who talked about the difficulty of adapting this classic and explained exactly why he made certain changes in the story . There 's a section that shows the actors learning the art of fencing . And a section that shows how the sets were built . These extras were like icing on a cake and certainly enhanced the experience of the film . < p > I loved it . And highly recommend it . Especially the DVD version .",f,1
"Sadly to say , this film is a barebone , cheesy adaption of Duma 's original epic . The original novel was excellent , it had taken the Count of Cristo decades to plot and carry out his revenge bit by bit . It was sweet revenge at its ultimate ; his enemies were slowly tourmented in a cat & mouse sort of game . However in this movie , events fly by so fast that the entire story seems to happen over night . Most key characters were either deleted or under developed , and large chucks of the main story lines were cutted . These two reasons had made the Count 's revenge very unsatisfying , as such it 's my opinion that they had ruined a great story .",m,0
"The '02 release of `The Count of Monte Cristo ' boasts a superb cast and lavish settings in an outstanding retelling of this classic story of romance and revenge . James Caviezel is perfect as the outwardly stately and poised Count . However his appearance is but a mask to disguise the torment of a man imprisoned and beaten for 13 years . His only desire now is for revenge against his once best friend Fernand Mondego Guy Pearce who betrayed him and stole his love , the enchanting Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk . A classic tale that can be enjoyed again and again !",m,1
"If you have read Dumas ' The Count of Monte Cristo then you know that it is a tale that begins but developing the character of Edmond Dantes . He is a simple man whose main ambition is to marry the beautiful Mercedes . He proposes to her and on the night of their engagement he is arrested for treason , betrayed by his best friend . This is a summation of the first chapter . The second and maybe third chapter relates his time in prison , learning and growing from his relationship with a fellow prisoner . He also learns from this prisoner the location of a treasure suitable for a dozen kings . The remaining 90 % of the book relates the immensley complicated details of his revenge on those that tore from him the life he held so precious . It is a tale of intrigue and revenge that takes its time to build and develop . When you see the traps swinging closed on Dante 's enemies you feel a sense of accomplishment with him . Now , on to the movie . The first full half of the movie relates Dante 's betrayal and captivity . This leaves only an hour to illustrate his revenge . What is accomplished is a sad imitation of Alexandre Dumas ' master work . This is one of my favorite books , and one of my least favorite movies . Hollywood 's need for adventure movies to be fast paced to match today 's lifestyle has ruined this story for many people . They just do n't know it .",m,0
"Calling this movie after Alexandre Dumas ' original novel is like calling Bernstein 's 'West Side Story ' 'Romeo and Julliette ' after Shakespeare 's work . So many elements of the story were altered that Dumas ' original plot and theme are no longer recognizable except for the names of some of the characters . They might as well call this film 'The Count of Hollywood ' and set the story in modern L . A . instead of 19th century France . In this film , Dantes is informed of the mission to rescue Napoleon from the onset as opposed to finding about it when returning to shore . Danglars is barely in the picture and is cast as a pirate instead of a banker . Mercedes marries Fernand one month after Dantes is imprisoned instead of 18 months So much for her loyalty : why would Dantes even forgive her in the end if she were such a tramp ? Luigi Vampa is depicted as the captain who brings Dantes to the island of Monte Cristo right after his escape instead of being a murdering Italian kidnapper he meets much much later . Dante 's Turkish guards are ommitted from the story : there 's no Princess Haydee or Ali . There 's also no Caderousse . In short , this movie has really little if anything to do with Alexandre Dumas ' classic 'Le Comte de Monte Cristo . If that 's the story you want to see on film , do n't see this film . I strongly recommend the French 1998 mini-series instead of this farce : although Gerard DePardieu 's dinstinctive physique undermines his role as a master of disguise , his performance of the role is otherwise excellent . The mini-series is much more faithful to the characters , plots , and themes Dumas sought to convey in his literary masterpiece .",m,0
"I ca n't belive they dis such a horrible work on this movie , if they would have stuck to the plot that went on in THE BOOK , you know , where they got the idea from , then the movie would have been a success . But since hollywood likes to ruin great works of art , then they do what they did with this movie , they BLEW IT ! ! ! ! If you really want to get the true feel of The Count Of Monte Cristo , then READ THE BOOK , YOU WO N'T BE DISSAPOINTED THERE .",m,0
"Apparently someone who read the book 5 years ago gave the screenwriter a brief rundown on the plot . Holy [ cow ] . I really enjoyed the book and this was a big letdown . Huge parts of movie are new , and enormous pieces of the original plot are left out . It would be one thing if the changes made the transition to film easier , as with Lord of the Rings , but I do n't think they even tried . Dumas is not exactly the most daring or controversial writer ; I 'm not sure why a perfectly good story , and ending , had to be filled up with enough dairy to rival a cheese castle . If you have n't read the book in a while or at all and you do like this movie , or even if you think it was allright , please take the time to read or review the book . Maybe the makers did n't want to spoil the book for that have n't read it , I 'm not sure . There 's much more satisfaction at the end than an illegitimate child and a duel between two people that were never `` boyhood friends . ``",m,0
"I was partway through the rantings of another reviewer about how much this movie strayed from a classic . And how bad this adaptation was . But you know what ? I do n't really care . I have n't read the book , and I likely wo n't . I happen to like the film . It has a decent plot , good actors and a theme someone simple-minded as myself can understand - `` revenge '' . How often have we felt cheated in our lives ? How often have we felt that we are the underdogs ? This film shows us that good things will come to those who wait . That revenge is sweetest when it is well thought out and exacted with a fury . < p > In this story a sailer by the name of Edmond Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned when his best friend Fernand betrays him in order to steal his wife . In prison , Edmond is about to lose hope when a fellow inmate teaches him how to read write fight and escape from prison . At his dying breath , he tells Edmond of a buried treasure that he should use to do good . Edmond , however , has other thoughts in his mind . Edmond transforms himself into the mysterious and wealthy Count of Monte Cristo . With systematic planning , he cleverly inserts himself into high society and exacts revenge from his enemies of the past . His goal is not to kill them , but to humiliate them and let them know what it feels like to have nothing left to live for . < p > . . . The movie was fun to watch , so watch it .",m,1
"Very inferior to the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version . It 's as if a chimp took a sledgehammer to the story and knocked all the sense out of it . The characters are dumbed down and the actors are forced into flat caricatures except for a fine performance by Richard Harris . Caviezal is unable to transform the guileless young Dantes into the dynamic Machiavellian . When he makes his entrance as The Count of Monte Cristo , he limply floats onto the scene and sighs , `` Glad you could all make it to my party . `` Since most of the movie was shot in the dark , there is little for the eyes here . Even the music disappoints .",m,0
"This story is based on the classic Alexander Dumas book . The story is about friendship , jealousy , betrayal and then the best part the ultimate revenge and then love rediscovered . I believe this book has been adapted to the silver screen several times but I have only seen the version where Richard Chamberlain plays the count and despite Chamberlain 's obvious acting limitations I much preferred that version to this updated one . The main reason for this is that the way the revenge comes together in that movie seemed to be more cunning , complicated and satisfying . < p > The story is based around two friends who have sailed the world together . One grows jealous of the other as even though he Guy Pearce is a member of the aristocracy ; the other Jim Caviezel is more popular respected and also has a love-life . The Pearce character plots a dastardly plan removing Caviezel from France and sending away to a life term in prison where he may just as well be dead . The prison scenes are quite awful with some pretty dire dialogue and lines coming from the prison warden and are only made interesting by the brief appearance of fellow prisoner Richard Harris . Harris tells Caviezel of the vast riches to be found on the Italian island of Monte Cristo . Caviezel who was quite a loving character has now understandably changed and is obsessed with getting revenge on the three characters who placed him in this predicament . This aspect of the film I found very dissappointing-in fact some of the scenes are very poorly done . The counts reappearance to public life is way over the top and looks more like a scene from Moulin Rouge . The revenge on the attorney which takes place in a steam room is utterly absurd . By the time he reveals himself I found I really did n't care less anymore and was quite looking forward to the closing credits ! < p > I had anticipated having scene the trailer that this would be a lavish period drama with no expense spared . This movie at times is quite the opposite-the scene set in Rome is a terrible recreation and in facts looks like just a small studio setting . The scenes set in Marseille and the final scene could also be described as being pretty lame . Still though the fact that this is such a marvellous story saves the movie and would make it worth watching if you are unfamiliar with this classic novel .",m,0
"This is a very good movie but , the only thing it has in common with the book is the movie has some of the characters . There , that 's it . The movie could have been named anything but , not `` The Count of Monte Cristo . `` If you really want the whole story , read the book . It 's a great book . A good movie but , it has nothing to do with the book .",m,0
"This adaptation of Alexander Dumas 's THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO plays out more like a big budget A & E 'movie of the week ' than it does a major motion picture of swashbuckling adventure . < p > However , there 's a rousing and sweet joy in watching Edmund Dantes played with infrequent success at achieving one accent by Jim Caviezel carry out his plot to seek vengeance on those who stole his life away . Unjustly accused of treason , Dantes endures 16 years of solitude , most in prison , where he manages to meet a fellow prisoner Richard Harris and , together , they embark on an attempt to achieve their great escape . Guy Pearce L . A . CONFIDENTIAL , MEMENTO is put to wonderful use as the villain , and he proves he can chew scenery with the best of them . < p > Perhaps the only disappointment the film has is the lack of swordplay . In an interview , Caviezel stated that he took fencing lessons for six weeks even learning how to fence with both hands simultaneously , but there 's little swash to this buckle on the silver screen ; in fact , Caviezel only picks up a foil three times . The climax duel between the rivals is far too short for my tastes ; instead , I found myself enjoying the ride more than the destination .",m,1
The cast was good as was the the movie in general were it not for the fact that the story was so different from the actual book . It was a real dissappointment to say the least .,m,0
This is a great story of the Count of Monte Christo and how he became the count via the betrayal of a close friend and the tutoring of 'the prist ' in prison . Very inspiring movie I would recommend without any reservation .,m,1
"I had been searching for a blu-ray copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and had given up . Luckily , Amazon sends me messages when their DVDs are on sale . This last time , there it was ! Thanks , Amazon !",f,1
"This is an excellent movie . Even though it is & quot ; a typical Holly Wood production & quot ; , it did n't mutilate the plot so much you could n't even recognize the title of it . Edmond Dantes is protrayed perfectly but Mercedes ' actress does n't look like the real Mercedes . The film shows every thing that gets the theme of the book across , and the changes made fall into place . Even though I had my hands clutched in terror during parts of it , I still laughed and cried . It was a wonderful movie and the ending is so sweet . Even though the book 's ending was sweet , this one has the 'happily ever after ' part added to it . And all the subplots were eliminated , so were many characters so it is much easier to follow . And even though the film goes by so fast , the actions of the characters results in a lot of development .",f,1
"Edmond Dantes Jim Caviezel and his best friend Fernand Guy Pierce are forced to dock ship to save the life of their captain . Napolean will only offer medical assistance if Edmond delivers a letter from Napolean to Versaille . Little does Edmond know that it contains plans to overthrow the king . When Edmond and Fernand return , Edmond is promoted to captain of the ship and becomes engaged to his one true love Mercedes Dagmara Domincyzk . Fernand becomes jealous of Edmond 's life and he also feels betrayed when he manages to find out about the letter . He turns Edmond into the authorities . Now Edmond is branded a traitor to France and sentenced to life imprisonment in the worst prison imaginable . Mercedes is told by the crown prosecutor that Edmond is dead , and she marries Fernand . While inside , Edmond befriends a priest Richard Harris who educates him , teaches him to fight , and lets him know of a treasure of the Island of Monte Cristo . Edmond promises his friend that he will escape and find the treasure . Edmond finally does after 14 years and uses the treasure to become the Count of Monte Cristo . As the count , Edmond plans to gain revenge on Fernand and the Crown Prosecutor James Frain , as well as win back Mercedes . < p > Count of Monte Cristo has an amazing story of revenge and love , outstanding acting , and thrilling swashbuckling action that will keep you glued to the screen . Jim Caviezel nails the role of Edmond Dantes to perfection . Guy Pierce does an amazing job as Fernand . His treacherous ways make him the perfect villan . Dagmara Domincyzk does a nice job as Mercedes . I also enjoyed James Frain 's performance as the Crown Prosecutor . The best performance has to be by Richard Harris . Harris 's portrayal of the priest is excellent . The story itself will keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end and the fighting sequences are top notch . The only problem I had with the film , is that the adaptation did not really follow the book at all . However , the film still manages to be enjoyable , and in some instances , it is even better than the book . < p > The supberb acting , thrilling action sequences , and overall story are responsible for making Count of Monte Cristo one of my all time favorite films . The DVD offers outstanding picture and sound quality , as well as some nice special features as well . This is definately a film that I consider a must own .",m,1

"The book , The Count of Monte Cristo , is one of my favorites . I know that movies can miss certain elements in the book and that usually the book is better . So I can forgive most movies even if they miss some things . But this movie seems to have missed the point entirely . It seems that they thought sword fights and one-liners where what this story is about . Where the book created this fully fleshed world of Edmond Dantes , the movie is like the superficial Hollywood version of the hastily read cliff notes . If you are looking for a movie that takes the themes from this book accurately , then watch the movie , SLEEPERS . with Jason Patrick , Brad Pitt , Robert DeNiro , etc . Even though the time and place and people are entirely different , the story of this film rings more true to the heart of the novel , The Count of Monte Cristo , than any film version of the book I 've ever seen . Read the book , and watch both movies and you 'll see why .",f,0
"Dumas ' stories have been filmed so often , yet it still is a joy to see them . This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception . It has serious flaws and errors , too numerous to list . For example : modern language lines , totally unbelievable interpretations as other reviewers mentioned , very amateurish characterizations the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his nearly unchanged looks . None of these things really disgusted me . I just sat back and enjoyed . The opening scene set a mood and the photography generally showed fine settings . The very end was incredibly sappy , but since I had just watched a wonderful fighting fencing scene with a lush green setting , I did n't care too much . A strong complaint I have about most new movies : the voices are almost inaudible compared to the background music and noises . I hope you will read the book , if you have n't already . No film ever has done Dumas ' story telling power justice . The Three Musketeers film version with Michael York as d'Artagnan came close . If you 're willing just to be entertained , this movie may fit your mood . I saw it three times by now .",f,1
"This movie is a wonderful work of art . It should have won an Oscar ! The movie is set in France with lush backgrounds and a truly incredible story based on the book by Alexander Dumas . Not only is it a terrific tale of love and survival , it is also a feast for the adventure fan . The Count of Monte Cristo is filled with enough swordfights , daring escapes , and backstabbing comrades to satisfy any viewer . I highly recommend this movie .",m,1
"What an unmitigated piece of garbage . Richard Harris is always wonderful but he 's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas ' classic . See the G & eacute ; rard Depardieu mini-series instead . If you can ignore the fact that he does n't look starved in the Chateau d'If , it 's wonderful . Except for Harris the acting is poor . The people are unrealistic and are , at best , caricatures of Dumas ' creations . The writer has committed a crime .",m,0
"Well , there 's one thing that 's hard to go wrong with and that 's a classic story . It 's hard to fault the plot , when it 's based on a renowned classic like Dumas ' The Count Of Monte Cristo , even if it is a simple revenge tale . Unfortunately , none of the acting rises above the page . < p > None of the leading men are quite manly . James Caviezel who plays Edmond Dantes and Guy Pearce , who plays Fernand Mondego both come across a little weak as swashbucklers . Caviezel tends to be a blank slate anyway , but I really liked Pearce in Memento , so I was a little disappointed to see his be such a weak character . You do dislike Fernand Mondego and want to see him meet his demise , but Pearce could have taken it much further and given Caviezel more distance to grow as a character . Richard Harris may have walked through this role , but he delivers the best performance of all the actors . < p > Overall , it 's a good Saturday movie if you want to watch some guys sword fight a little bit and not have to think to much .",m,0
I have a blu-ray player that is a year old . The firmware is from this year . This is the first blu-ray disc that will not play . I tried two copies that were in perfect condition . Do not buy this disk .,m,0

This movie is the events of Dumas ' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure love story . The formula is the same used in 80 's montage movies : 1 Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men . 2 Kid has a montage . 3 Kid gets revenge .,m,0
"This is easily one of the five worst movies I 've ever seen . Forget that , it 's one of the *two* worst movies I 've ever seen . While Guy Pearce is usually an excellent actor , and Jim Caviezel has the perfect look for Edmund Dantes at least , post-imprisonment , there is nothing that could have saved such a woefully terrible screenplay . The Dumas novel is one of the best books I 've ever read , filled with intrigue , action , and mystery , with vibrant characters and brilliant plotting . Granted , adapting such a grand story to the screen would probably take four hours or more , but if one is n't going to attempt an adaptation of the original story , then one should just make a new movie . That being said , all the interesting , original parts of the book were removed and replaced with a cookie-cutter revenge plot , stereotypical , one-dimensional characters , and bland dialogue that too often inserts modern slang into Napoleonic-era France . This movie is the `` Count of Monte Cristo '' in name only , and in every other way , a poorly conceived , vapid , dime-a-dozen action flick . Avoid it at all costs .",m,0
"My only reason for seeing this film is because Luis Guzman is in it . I find these Napoleon Shakespeare pirate films to very very dull , boring and over-long . Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing . Does n't he look handsome in that red English coat ?",m,0
"As a movie the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining on its own but when compared to the book it is horrible . There are several instances where Hollywood had its way with the plot . The revelation about who Alberts real father is being the worst . This did not happen in the book . The movie lacks the style of the book . The Count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never stooped to getting is hands diry himself . I also do n't recall any sword fights in the book although they were decent , but nothing spectacular . As I said , taken on its own the movie is entertaining but it deviates terribly from the book which is superior in everyway .",m,0
"Personally , I never read the book this story is based on so I think my look into the movie is on a movie itself scale which would be entirely different if you read the book . That said , the movie is fantastic in my opinion . As a viewer I was instantly pulled into the storyline and consistently brought to the edge of my seat moment after moment waiting for the next piece of action to occur . And I find it hard to believe but the moments when his revenge is enacted I felt a personal joy seeing Dante take it . The story itself , as mentioned by others as well , is about a man who is betrayed , locked away in a prison forever , forgotten , freed by a chance situation , given a great treasure , and with the means to do it given a chance to take revenge for being wronged . Yes , at times Dante is extravagant , as mentioned in other reviews , but I think the director was interweaving the current culture into the story to better adapt it to the audience so perhaps this was a necessary change . With our semi-materialistic world view where the bigger and flashier the more exciting it probably seemed like a good choice to keep us entertained . Yes , in the time of the book 's release this would have been seen as silly but it keeps audiences today interested which perhaps is more important . Anyhow , this movie is a solid , fun , exciting movie and while it 's not the sort you 'll see reviewed as a groundbreaking gem to add to your collection it 's definitely worth having if only to whip out from time to time . You 'll enjoy this one .",m,1
"I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline . Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book , the `` boy getting the girl '' in the end offers more satisfaction",m,1
"Director Reynolds fashions a handsome , sweeping , exciting epic that keeps his audience glued in place . Pearce 's Fernand is so despicably low , we can not wait for the long-suffering Edmond to wreak vengeance . In this hugely entertaining picture , revenge is a dish served hot , and adventure fans are sure to feel sated by the end . Also , solid family viewing- with older children .",m,1
I have loved to watch this movie from the day it hit the movie theaters . I now own it and watch it often .,f,1
One of the best movies I 've seen . Makes me feel good every time I watch it . The good guys win .,f,1
"The Count of Monte Cristo is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end . Starring the handsome Jim Caviezel in the lead role of Edmond Dantes and the Count , the story takes you on a nonstop ride of adventure . Also starring Guy Pearce as his best friend turned enemy The Count Mondego . The Count of Monte Cristo will leave you breathless . Revenge is sweet for after being wrongly convicted of a crime , Edmond is sent to prison for 13 years , were he meets a compassionate priest played by Richard Harris . After the sudden death of the priest and the joyest escape , Edmond sets out on a journey of revenge . Slowly taking everything from his ex-best friend the Count Mondego , Edmond who is now the Count of Monte Cristo , hatches a plan to seek the ultimate revenge against the people who had plotted to ruin his life . With period costume designs by Tom Rand , and under the very capable direction of Kevin Reynolds , The Count of Monte Cristo is an adventure waiting to happen , with a few twists on the way .",f,1
"I was going to leave a review saying something like , `` Apart from the book , it 's a good movie - but poor Mr . Dumas ! If I were him , I 'd rise from the grave to haunt those filmmakers for what they did to my story . . . `` But then I saw all these excellent reviews here that had already addressed the subject and gave detailed explanations of how the movie was different from the book , what parts were changed the most , and whether those changes were justified . So I guess I will not repeat what has already been said so well ; instead , I 'll just tell you what I personally liked about the movie . < p > First of all I would like to say that whenever the movie mentions God , it is done in a very appropriate way , neither profane nor preachy . Another accomplishment that goes along the same line is the portrayal of Faria , who is a believer and at the same time a respectable figure . There have always been jerks among Christians , but there have always been admirable people as well . Sometimes moviemakers seem to forget that part . < p > Another reviewer mentioned that they appreciated not having to cover their kids ' eyes because there were no sexually explicit scenes in the movie . I agree ; there was one somewhat close , but it could have been so much worse since there is a love story involved . < p > Overall , it is a good movie . Love , friendship , betrayal , long suffering , fantastic escape , instant riches , revenge - everything you need for a great adventure , plus a deeper meaning to ponder .",f,1
"Going into the film I expected a good time , watching an okay movie and hanging with some pals . What I got was a good time , hanging with pals and watching an excellent movie ! The much-filmed story gets restyled with youthful actors and an interesting script , not to mention the intriguing story . The story I am speaking of is that of Edmond Dantes played with innocence and then anger by Jim Caviezel who seems to be riding the high life with a new job as captain and a beautiful fiancee until he is arrested for treason . What Edmond does n't know at first is that he has been set up by his jealous friend Ferdinand played with evil smarmyness by Guy Pearce . With such high caliber acting and beautiful settings , it 's tough not to be completely drawn into this story . I highly recommend that if you 're going to the theaters this weekend , that you check this one out .",f,1
"When I first saw this movie , I was surfing the limited channels on our television a week or so ahead of the time they would actually come on so that I could catch any that sounded promising . This was one of those . The description sounded good and a few of the actors ' names sounded familiar , although I had never seen any of their movies to date . So , last night when my sister and I had nothing to do , we decided to switch it on . And let me tell you . It was worth it . Though a little confusing at times , I found this movie highly enjoyable . It also made sense , which was good . There seemed to be a reason for everything . And , okay I 'll just say it . One of the main reasons this is such a good movie is because Jim Caviezel was the main character . Like I said , I had never seen any of his movies and I still have n't exept for this one , of course so , I was somewhat surprised to see how hot he was . I mean , yes , it did take some time for me to see the full extent of it , but when I did , I could n't stop talking and thinking about it . You would think that it was utterly impossible for a man to look hot in all the stages of his life , miserable as it was at times . I mean , he looked hot in every single scene . Especially as the Count . Basically this is a movie about revenge . Edmund Dontes is in love with this girl named Mercedees , but ca n't marry her because he is too poor to buy a ring . He is charged with high treason for delivering a letter for someone , and is sent to prison at a horrible place where he stays for 13 years . Meanwhile Mercedees and his best friend , who actually helped frame him , get married . Edmund escapes and finds all this treasure and gets really rich . He then decides to get revenge on everyone who wronged him . This is a pretty good movie . I would n't give it five stars though . Probably about 4 . 5 or something . But Jim Caviezel helps a bunch . He is a really good actor . I guess you wo n't know 'til you watch it .",f,1
"This movie provides one of the best film interpretations of Dumas ' book I 've seen . Although much of the plot is cut out , realistically this movie is a great adaptation of an amazing book . If you choose to see this movie , be sure to read the unabridged version of the book as well . Even if you 're not in it for the literature , this movie is an exciting watch regardless .",m,1
Because I read the Count of Monte Cristo in it 's entirety three times in high school I was disappointed with the liberties the director has taken in this cinematic version of the film . It starts out fine but about 1 5th of the way into the movie it begins to depart dramatically from the book . I guess if you have never read the book the movie might be ok but I was so hoping to see the whole story of the Count of Monte Cristo told in all it 's glory in the DVD . The story line is based loosely on the story as written by Alexandre Dumas but it departs in very significant ways from the book so much so that by the end it does n't resemble the book at all .,m,0
"Only an eternal optimist expects great things from a book-to-screen adaptation . This optimist expected at least good things from this 2002 version of Dumas ' classic tale of revenge , mostly due to the casting of Guy Pearce and James Caviezel . But just a few short minutes into the film , it becomes apparent that this was going to be the & quot ; Count of Monte Cristo & quot ; in name only . < p > In my view the power of the book rests in the character of Edmond Dantes later the Count . In the film version , Monte Cristo is depicted as a rich fool , unable to command respect and totally devoid of subtlety : witness the deus ex machina hot air balloon entrance of the Count onto the Paris scene . How absurd ! In Dumas ' exquisite story , Monte Cristo wielded an unquestionable power over all he came in contact with . Quite the opposite is true of Caviazel 's Cristo . But this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg . The movie lacks character development of even the few antagonists and protagonists it chose to include . As one reviewer noted , the book Monte Cristo was able turn his enemies into monkeys , while this film just makes a monkey of itself . < p > Taken as completely separate from the book , this is a decent film . The acting , costume and set design , and action sequences are very respectable . This is an average movie in and of itself . It becomes less than average strictly because of its association with a sublime work of French literature , which is resembles not .",m,0
"It wo n't trouble the Oscar voters , it wo n't stimulate intense discussion and debate , but by crikey , this adaptation of Dumas ' classic novel will make you forget about the drudgery of life for a couple of hours . < p > This , in my opinion , is Kevin Reynolds best film since Fandango . . . and it 's been some time ! He sticks to a formula of being fairly true to the book and keeping it simple - doing just enough to produce a piece of total entertainment . He is of course working with great source material , and yes , we all know the story , but it 's still great fun and thoroughly enjoyable . < p > Jim Caviezel is simply spot on as the hard-done-by-hero Edmund Dantes . As he showed in Angel Eyes , no-one does doe-eyed innocence like Jim , and he simply smoulders as the vengeful Count . He has the screen presence of a 1940s movie idol - tall , broad , quiet and dignified - and you thought they did n't make 'em like that anymore ! And , as he demonstrated in The Thin Red Line and Frequency , he is a fine actor . If they have any sense , producers will be queuing up to give him the sort of meaty roles that will guarantee him leading man status . < p > Guy Pearce has fun as the evil Count Mondego . Kudos to the hair-dressing department for creating a `` do '' worthy of Best Supporting Hair Piece status , but I think he thinks he is Alan Rickman in Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , but he just does n't quite cut it . < p > The leading lady is suitably beautiful and Richard Harris again turns in a scene-stealing supporting performance . < p > Yes , there are big old holes in the plot , but , if you 're willing to check your brain at the door and be entertained , then buy a big bucket of popcorn , put your feet up and enjoy every minute of action and every frame of fabulous scenery in this movie . Yes , it is fluff . . . but marvellously escapist fluff at that . In a time of such horror and violence in the world , a film like this is surprisingly welcome .",f,1
"Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film ! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear .

"Keep up the good work Danny ! I hope you do another documentary on this ever expanding problem . Reward cards are something that need looking at more closely . Who is actually paying these `` rewards '' . It 's the merchant fees that we all pay for whether we use credit cards or not ! Fact is , many people ca n't use a reward card or simply do n't want to deal with greedy credit card co 's and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they do n't get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go , they take credit cards . And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices ! And these card co 's have it set up so the merchants ca n't give a lower price for cash customers ! It 's outrageous ! And I hope you do more about debt buyers . It 's insane these co 's can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest . Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed ! Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest ! It does n't make any sense to put someone in debt further . And last but not least , these predators who flood the mailboxes of the newly bankrupt should not be allowed to send them any mail for at least ten years . That is the amount of time bankruptcy remains on someones credit report . If the newly bankrupt want to get back in the credit card game , then let them find these cos . There should be a law that these co 's with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy . Unfortunatly , some will not understand these offers or will be desperate . They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like `` we want to help you re establish your credit '' or `` you deserve a second chance '' . Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again ! These co 's will even extend credit to people living below the poverty line ! !",f,1
"This is a very good documentary on the subject of credit card debt and predatory lending , but does n't pack the emotional punch of a similar documentary titled Maxed Out that came out roughly at the same time . The documentary shows as a society that the middle and lower classes are drowning in a sea of debt from payday loan places and credit card debt . It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern , but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information . It does however show you that debt is often not caused by stupidity or foolishness but by circumstances that could affect any one of us .",f,0
"This powerful program exposed the credit card industry and how with the political power of Congress trap the consumer into what the program produced called `` 21st century serfdom '' . This program was made before the 2008 economic melt-down and it was so true that the country is still on the rocky road despite the government declared recession was over two years ago , as the unemployed max out the 99 weeks of benefits . As recent as last week , the political leaders of both parties argued in Congress to raise the debt ceiling to borrow more while still accusing others of currency manipulation . Spend , spend , and spend out of a recession ? Will our kids , grand-kids , great grand-kids inherit this debt which may endanger our status , credit and national security ?",m,1
Sharply critical of our national and personal use of debt to finance lifestyles beyond our means and an indictment of the credit banking mortgage industry engaged in predatory lending and usurious interest rates . This film came out in 2006 ; it 's eerily prophetic of what happened to our economic house of cards in 2008 .,m,1
This is clearly a great flick that lets the viewer 'see ' how the banks view you the credit consumer . It really goes into accurate detail on how the finance industry is trying to snare consumers from and young age and create a generation of debt slaves . They also have a chilling prediction on where all this 'debt ' is heading . I highly recommend this flick .,m,1
I went on a debt reduction program on my own at 42 years old and now at 45 I am debt free . I recommend that you buy this DVD at any price . I also recommend that you do n't watch it alone . Let some others benefit from the knowledge of what debt has and is doing to our society . Even if they do n't do anything about it at least they will have the education of how the debt system works .,m,1

"I have been obsessed with Van Gogh , since I first laid eyes on his originals in L . A . . Prints of his work just do n't show the awe inspiring life force that emanates from his paintings . `` Through the Eyes of Van Gogh '' is a sensitive and intense work of art in itself . It achieves an externalization of Van Gogh 's internal struggles of trying to make a living , trying to relate to others , trying to hold on to his unique vision of art and his brave battle with mental illness , all of which he felt he failed at , at the time of his suicide . I feel this film brilliantly achieves looking through the eyes of Van Gogh , by focusing on his time in the mental hospital with the addition of flashbacks to pivotal points in his life . The writer , who is also the actor who portrays Vincent , has created a portrait of Van Gogh that is as palpable as his paintings .",f,1
"I took a chance on this low cost download , hoping the low-budget art-house movie would interest my mind and entertain me . First , the digital quality forced me to either sit far back or to shrink the image on my screen . I 've have better image quality with VHS videos . The best attributes of the content were a decent makeup face of the actor playing the artist , and a plain-looking painted wall in one of the rooms had some 'potential ' . Other than that , there is nothing to interest the viewer visually . The asylum and people do n't look like late 19th Century southern France . They do n't even try to behave , look , or sound French . Just a little is all that 's needed for the viewers imaginations to pick up on something . No views of the countryside or closeups of anything interesting to set the stage or mood . Lighting skills were absent . The entire first 20 minutes could have been just a few lines with some emotion and visuals to set the tone , but rather it 's an immense amount of words spoken by the actor either to himself or to someone else . Worse , the words are like they are read from a poorly written book . No other conflicts , nothing else going on , and simply no theatrical or cinematic 'artistry ' . After 20 minutes , I fast forwarded to see if anything else happened different , but was disappointed . I 've seen low budget do well before , but this lacks all those little elements that are needed to make it something entertaining .",m,0
"One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white movie is not an especially good movie . BUT , it is a fun movie . It is a silly horror comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios . I love it . Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse . He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler Bela Lugosi . He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar . However , unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office . Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room . When he does try to get out , he ca n't open the door , etc . This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable . But that 's the fun of it . A huge dark creepy house , a will to be read , a suspicious looking butler and cook , a beautiful damsel in distress , a dim witted detective , a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased , murders , trick doors , screams and noises at night , etc . Of course , a very nervous and reluctant hero . This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide . I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun . ~ . ~",f,0
"This is yet another of the gathered-for-the-reading-of-the-will-in-the-spooky-house with-secret-passages-and-a-murderer subgenre . And while I find it hard to believe that there is anyone who legitimately can hate these kind of movies , there are admittedly some that work far better than others . One Body Too Many finds middle ground . < p > It begins with some cleverness in setting up the scenario . The will 's gimmick is farfetched but assured an offbeat night of criminal mayhem : The deceased , an astrologer , wishes to be buried above ground so that the stars shine down on him . If anything happens so that he is not , then the heir who was supposed to get the most will instead get the least , and vice versa . The body disappears , then reappears , then someone else is murdered . . . it 's all expectedly , even appropriately , convoluted . < p > Our hero is a life insurance salesman who is mistaken for the detective assigned to guard the body from shenanigans . And there is real inventiveness in placing a life insurance salesman in this situation , where people are sure to be bumped off . Unfortunately , this knowing wink to the audience is barely explored at all . The hero himself is an average-looking guy , more likable and less wimpy than many 40 's B heroes . And he is surrounded by a capable , if unspectacular , cast . < p > Lugosi is wasted , although his stock Ominous Butler character is interestingly played for laughs this go-round , ready and willing to bump off anybody who anyone else thinks needs bumping off . Watch out for the coffee . This is of course , a comedy mystery , as every picture in this genre has been since The Cat and the Canary in the 20 's . And the comedy is generally the determining factor in how watchable these kind of films are . Here it is not too bad , consisting less of the typical scared mugging and awkward pratfalls than many similar efforts . Only in its dull , protracted middle section does the film lose its way , as the hero gets lost in the ubiquitous secret passageways , caught in a wicker basket with a litter of kittens and wearing only a towel . Do n't ask . < p > There are a number of good scenes , including one where the hero , hiding in a coffin , is carried off and dumped in a pool . The movie ends with a suspenseful chase and confrontation atop the observatory . But there is not enough made of the good ideas in the script , and too much damage is done to the whole by the weak or old ideas in the script . You 've seen much of it before , so it 's not quite worth a purchase . Close but no cigar . < p > See also : The Cat and the Canary ; Black Cat 1941 ; Night Monster ; Old Dark House ; The Monster Walks ; The Gorilla ; Seven Keys To Baldpate ; The Bat Whispers ; and many , many more , if you are so inclined .",m,0
"`` One Body Too Many '' 1944 is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast .

In fact , Bela garners more laughs than Haley 's cut-rate version of Bob Hope .",m,0
"When rich man Cyrus J . Rutherford dies all the heirs show up for the reading of a bizarre will . While Cyrus 's unique tomb is constructed , the heirs stay in the house . The will insults the heirs , then claims that some will get vasts amounts while others get cab fare . If Cyrus 's body is not interned by his wishes then the heirs will swap places , i . e . those that get the most will now get the least . No one knows who is going to get what , they can only guess . . . or does someone know ? Bela plays the butler who tries to give everyone `` poisoned '' coffee late in the evening , which they all refuse . Jack Haley The Tin Man plays an insurance agent who shows up to sell the dead Cyrus a policy , not knowing he is deceased . The guests mistake him for the detective they hired to guard the body . Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs . . . Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs . They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share . Sweet Carol Dunlap Jean Parker is suspected of getting the largest share . Lyle Talbot , who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from `` Death Valley Days . `` The sound track at times indicates this is a `` horror '' film while at other times a comedy . It is far from a horror movie . At one point when someone is killed , the suspects are all gathered into one room , as a real who-dun-it murder mystery , except with the comedy of Jack Haley leading the spoof . This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time . The jokes are a bit punny . It is not a blockbuster , but one that certainly can be enjoyed and appreciate by a younger generation . My only negative on this film is that the copy I saw could have used some restoration , especially the sound track .",m,1

"My dear , dear friend , & quot ; time-lapse photography , & quot ; introduced itself to me in & quot ; The Time Machine , & quot ; and I was forever changed . It showed me worlds I had not seen , at least , not in a fantastical sense . As a boy in the Seventies , I was not able to see this film in the theater , but the impact it made on me was equal to a nuclear explosion . The giddy feeling of following the intrepid time traveller through the ages was like climbing Everest for the first time , or stepping foot on the Moon . That may be hyperbole , but the thrill of seeing a lit candle melt quickly down to the candlestick in seconds was palpable . Electric . Captivating . I absorbed every image , every sound , and I was there with Rod Taylor every step of the way . It was an exhilerating ride , and it 's one I highly recommend that you take . I hope that the ride is as thrilling for you as it was for me .",m,1
"By today 's standards this movie might be weak . The special effects are primitive and it is not pushing H . G . Well 's point . Nonetheless , I have watched this movie everytime it has appeared on t . v . It has a certain charm and innocence , not to mention that Rod Taylor derserved more work as a leading man . Maybe it is my & quot ; guilty pleasure , & quot ; but this movie never grows tiresome . I recommend this movie to any sic-fi fan and to everyone else ! .",m,1
"This film ranks as quite literaly my all time favorite . It has everything in it : Great sets , great actors , an H G Wells storyline , time travel , monsters , Yvette , the lot . I first watched this movie on a Halloween night on TV many years ago and just fell in love with it . This viewing was years before video became available so all I could look for was a sountrack album to the terrific Garcia score . Nope , it did n't exist . Then along came video . I waited for years before it came out . In all of that time it had not been re-screened on UK TV so I was watching it again with nothing short of a childhood memory that could have been devastated after so many years . This was not to be the case . It was still as good , if not better as I had since read the novel , read up on Pal and knew a lot more about the movie than it was when I first saw it . My wife kind of wishes that I did not like it so much as she finds the poster creepy see front cover of DVD - this was not used on the previous VHS versions and I had hunted high and low to obtain an original cinema poster which now hangs in our study . I am very pleased to see that MGM are tagging on the more recent documentary that was released seperately over here but was so limited in its distribution that I did not get a copy . It features Rod recreating the role of the Time Traveller so I believe , some dialogue and behind the scenes stuff . I can only say that I was excited when Amazon sent the email informing me that the movie was on its way and I ordered one right away . If you 've seen this movie and liked it , I believe that DVD will serve it well . If you have not seen this movie , do n't let the fact that it was made in 1960 put you off . It is a vibrant , action packed spectacular that all should see . Thank you MGM for issuing this classic .",m,1

The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better . I will admit -- the special effects were cheesy , but what can you expect ? ? This movie was made in 1960 ! !

Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures . And in speaking of pictures , Pal and Disney established their own landmarks , from my point of view , with `` The Time Machine '' and `` 20 , 000 Leagues under the Sea '' respectively . `` The Time Machine '' may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking : it makes you believe for a moment it 's possible to travel through time .",m,1
"Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood : bubblegum trading cards , comic books , and George Pal movies . The early sixties was a great time to be a kid . With other classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth to entertain our eager young minds , our eyes frequently popped at the terrific adventures we witnessed onscreen . The Time Machine endures as great cinematic storytelling . When I was little , the movie scared me . Remember , the atomic attack comes in 1966 , which was still the future for us then . My favorite part has always been when George fast-forwards in his lab . However , that gave me some anxiety at the time because it disturbed me that he was leaving home and maybe never coming back . I thought the Morlocks were great monsters and seem to recall my friends and I dividing up between Morlocks and Eloi for some play fighting later . Of course it was more fun to be a Morlock than an Eloi . But if you got to be Rod Taylor , then you had ARRIVED . One of the interesting things I noted on my last viewing was the technology . 80 . 000 years into the future , what remains of knowledge is stored on old `` rings '' that spin to speak . I turned and looked at my ten-year-old son and said , `` That could be cds ! `` Round , shiny discs that play an audio recording when spinning-sounds just like a cd to me . Even in 1960 , this was amazingly prophetic . Also , I mentioned how great it would be to have a replica of the time machine . Then , `` our host '' , Robert Osbourne remarked as to how the prop had become lost and then years later bought at a THRIFT STORE ! Just imagine that lucky son-of-a-gun . It 's a shame that we 've grown to a time when special effects take precedent over character and story . Fortunately , an occassional film comes forward with both like LOTR but the newer Time Machine is not one of these . Rod Taylor and George Pal 's version is the one to see . Made in the midst of the Cold War , it 's a question of where are we going as a species : annihilation or ascension . Ultimately , it is an optimistic piece about the noble possibilities that endure despite neverending conflicts inherent in the human experience . Every generation has its Morlocks , and our choice remains : Are we Rod Taylor or an Eloi ?",m,1
"I can not say how faithful this movie is to the book , however it is an outstanding science fiction movie . The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today , but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay . Rod Taylor 's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note . The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done . It is a classic story well adapted to the screen . I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans .",m,1
"The Time Machine is one of the best science fiction films made and it has always been one of my favorites ! The first time I watched this was when I was in the first grade . The movie is about an inventor named George [ Rod Taylor ] who has greated a time machine and goes on a journey into the year 802701 . < p > The movie starts out when you see David Filby [ one of George 's friends ] walking up to George 's house where you see some more of his friends . Then eventually you see George but he 's been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey . Then he talks about the story . < p > In the next part , George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want 's to proove that time travel really exists . But , when his friends do n't believe him he decides to go on the long journey . < p > Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701 . Instead of having a lot of technology it 's just an area of grass . There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks . The morlocks give the Eloi their food , clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them . So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her . But , soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi do n't work very much and they mostly just play , so he goes back to his machine . But , thats when the trouble begins . The morlocks have stolen his machine ! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place . So , the only thing left to do is go to the underground area , kill the morlocks , save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time . < p > When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion . < p > In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again . < p > The special features include : Behind the scenes documentary time machine : the journey back , hosted by Rod Taylor and featuring Alan Young , Whit Bissel and others involved in the film soundtrack remastered in dolby digital 5 . 1 . Interactive Menus Theatrical Trailer , Filmogaphies of Tayor , Yvette Mimieux , Young and George Pal scene access , languages and subtitles in english and francais . < p > I loved every single part of this movie all the way through , the story is just amazing ! ! < p > This is a sci-fi classic everyone should own ! ! !",m,1
"If I only had a machine like that . . . . . . This movie get your attention and your curiosity . What would you do in the actor 's shoes ? . I only wish I had a machine like that . . . . . . . Overall : EXCELLENT . By the way , the new version on this movie is a joke . This is the one to watch .",m,1
"We watched this on Prime , being familiar with the story from a children 's book that our kids have . Given the age of the movie 1960 I did n't know what to expect . I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the acting , the sets , and the story itself . Obviously there are a few parts that are comically terrible given what we 're accustomed to in sci-fi and CGI today . But they do n't really detract from the overall experience , and the parts that are done well are simply excellent . Recommended .",m,1
"For a film from the 50 's , this one delivers . Would recommend this one to anyone , especiallysi-fi nuts like myself . You 'll enjoy it .",m,1
This was one of my favorite movies growing up at the Saturday matinees . The other one being Mysterious Island . I had problems with the sound and the actors not being in sync with what they were saying . Maybe it was just my computer but it was a problem .,m,1
I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down . personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake .,m,1
"Others have said it better so I 'll keep my review brief . The restoration work on this film is excellent : great sound , colors bright and sharp . DVD plays perfectly and there is a bonus on here of a documentary about the restoration of said machine , hosted by Rod Taylor , who is reunited with his old friend , Alan Young . They even do a short skit where Taylor attempts to rescue Alan Young 's character from his date with destiny tries to stop him from leaving for France , where he was killed in WWI , which gives fans of this great film one extra moment with the Time Machine cast members . I recommend the DVD to anyone who loves this great H . G . Wells story .",m,1
"Time travel has always fascinated me , and of course The Time Machine is the most basic time travel movie ever , right ? I 've never had a chance to read the book , but I found this an excellent film whose special effects stand up well to the test of time . Today 's digital age can make flowers bloom and snails race across the floor more realistically , but the scenes of the sun flying across the sky , for example , were great . And the real beauty of the movie was the story and the message behind it . It 's hard to judge anything that might happen 800 , 000 years into the future . Progressive authors have made some interesting predictions in the past look at the awesome flat-screen TVs in < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000087F6L '' > Fahrenheit 451 < a > ! . This story - and nothing we currently know , I imagine , will still be remembered in 800 , 000 years . H . G . Wells 's predictions will not be judged . But in the meantime , it was still an incredibly fun story . The only thing I found disturbing was that the Eloi came across so heartless . They were on the surface a peaceful people , but did n't have any attachments to each other . They were unconcerned when they lost members of their own families . Even in 800 , 000 years , I do n't really buy that people would evolve to that point .",f,1
"THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday , then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again . Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind , the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life . My own wondrous `` journey into the future '' via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s , and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions . This is a film that truly delivers . The special effects are outstanding . . . the acting superb . . . the drama riveting ! Rod Taylor , as the inventor of the time machine , is relentlessly -- believably ! -- heroic in the role of H . G . Wells ; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena ; Alan Young 's sensitive portrayal of David Filby the only one of Wells ' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells ' `` outlandish '' theories makes a lasting impression on the viewer . And one of the major , not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia , which I 'm listening to now as I write this review . The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama , while the `` London '' theme tugs gently at the heartstrings . There 's one gorgeous passage here that 's straight out of Debussy . Has anyone made note of it ? Do n't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world , and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago .",m,1
"The movie was bought for my English class to watch after they read the book . They were a little skeptical because it was filmed a while ago , but they ended up enjoying it . The DVD was in great condition .",f,1
"After all these years , `` The Time Machine '' 1960 remains a very entertaining movie . Of the five or six films produced by George Pal , `` The Time Machine '' , which was also directed by him , along with `` The War of the Worlds '' 1953 are probably his finest films . Both films are loosely based on the novels of H . G . Wells and , for their time , boasted state of the art special effects , for which both films won an Oscar . Rod Taylor is the lead character , supposedly H . G . Wells himself , who claims to his friends to have invented a time machine , allowing him to travel back and forth in time . His brief discussion with his friends , attempting to explain the principles of time travel , similar to the Wells novel , makes it seem almost plausible until one thinks about it a little longer . Taylor , whose British accent slowly fades away as the picture goes on , plays his character earnestly and is surrounded by an able cast : Sebastian Cabot , Tom Helmore , Whit Bissell , Yvette Mimieux , Doris LLoyd , very likable as his house maid , and , in particular , Alan Young , who delivers a perfect Scottish accent , as his devoted but practical-minded Scottish friend . Why not ? Alan Young grew up in Edinburgh . The special effects for this film are basically simple but effective , using time-lapse photography to simulate the acceleration of events that one would supposedly witness if he were rapidly moving forward in time . His journey , after a few brief stops to observe the two World Wars and a nuclear attack pointedly set in the mid 1960s , ultimately takes him several hundred thousand years into the future in which he encounters a race of `` beautiful people '' , the Eloi and a race of barbarous beings called the Morlocks who are literally living off the Eloi . At this point the screen play of the picture and the novel of H . G . Wells part company , the movie pretty much resorting to melodramatic action for its resolution . The video quality of the DVD is very good and the sound recording , as a pleasant surprise , is in genuine and high quality stereophonic sound although it was never presented that way in any theater in which I saw this film . The music is a rich orchestral score by Russ Garcia and adds a good deal to the effectiveness of the film . I thinks it 's safe to say that this film version of the Wells novel , with all of its shortcomings , still betters the 2002 remake in spite of the technical superiority of the newer film . Alan Young makes a brief but welcome cameo appearance in the 2002 film which , unfortunately , fails to convey the atmosphere of H . G . Wells that the older film , at least in places , manages to accomplish ,",m,1
"In addition to an all-time excellent movie , this edition supplies interviews with the cast and those who worked on the film with them . A very touching scene is played out between Rod Taylor and Alan Ladd , reprising their roles in the movie . This is too good of a deal to pass up . Glad I bought mine !",m,1
"Good movie in spite of the hokey special effects . But , considering what they had to work with , it is very good .",m,1
Remake of the original classic is a classic in itself . Great fantasy movie . . . great acting by all . A must own movie !,f,1
One 's imaginagion can not help but be stirred after viewing this timeless masterpiece . If you 're looking for a pleasant hour-plus of sci-fi type entertainment then this one is for you . Enjoy !,m,1
"When I was a kid I ca n't recall how many times I watched this film on the television , but it was always among my favorites . It still is . What 's great about getting older is how your experiences can actually improve on something that 's already among your favorites . Sadly , it also diminishes some of the things you thought you liked . Everything about this film now has the weight of emotional maturity working for it . Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world , even for what he thought was a brief trip , holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then . That 's especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event . This film opens with a restless man stuck in an age , his age , where he despises man 's futility but accepts that life amicably enough . It ends in a similar manner but now that man holds a sense of purpose , a goal he has set and will fulfill to the best of his ability . He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive . The FX of this film are dated . They have to be . But the story itself is timeless . Forgive the pun . The one disappointment is the battle towards the end . The Morlocks are not as scary as before . They 're just as vile , but pathetic . I also wish George Pal had insisted on a scene from the book where the time traveller sees the future after the Morlock time when the sun is dimming . Anyway , this has worn very well with age .",m,1
"A great movie . My family has watched it several times , and never get tired of it .",f,1
"The Time Machine is one hour and forty-three minutes long and was released on August 17 , 1960 . The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells George to his friends who invents a time machine . George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future . The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive . George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm . Just at the four guests are about to dine , George enters the room dirty and clothes torn . George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine . When the four friends leave the house , George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature . At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12 , 802 , 701 . George lands in an almost paradise world . The only downside is that there are two different classes of people . The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws , government and civilization . They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well . The Elois speak in a childlike way . The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground , operates the machinery , blue-skinned , and can not stand the light . The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks . The Morlocks clothe , feed , and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults . George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end . When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from . George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from . His four friends do not believe his story , but David Filby seems to believe some of it . The Time Machine won an Academy Award for Best Effects , Special Effects 1961 . The Time Machine is a great science fiction movie and gets an AAAAA+++++ .

"Just re-watched this movie this weekend and forgot how good it was . Alan Young plays Taylor 's best friend and there are great behind-the-scenes stories for this movie in Young 's book MISTER ED AND ME I believe that is the title also available on Amazon . com . If you love Morlocks , beautiful women , Oscar winning special effects and clever plots , this movie is for you .",m,1
"I first viewed this film when I was 11 years old and I must confess that seeing this movie impacted my whole life . I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors . The time machine itself , is so humorous , but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption . I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day . My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life . I consider this a much better movie than its `` twin '' Journey to the Center of the Earth , but they were both great and thought-provoking , especially to pre-teenagers . The scenes and special effects are phenomenal . It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own . Rod Taylor was not my favorite actor , but he did a very good job in this movie .",f,1
"I was very pleased with thr DVD `` The Time Machine '' , mailed to me recently . It was in excellent condition and met my expectations . Thank you .",f,1
"Its the greatest , like you saw it the first time . It has n't changed , maybe it has change a bit . LOOK OUT PAST , HERE COMES THE BEST ! !",f,1
"THE TIME MACHINE tells the story of Rod Taylor , an enterprising Victorian scientist who develops a way-back machine that crushes four dimensions into three , so that human beings can be transported through time as well as through space . The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed , and Rod Taylor , the Australian he-man star , does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around . His first moments inside the machine are thrilling , as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him , then light again , then dark , then whole months pass within instants , and then whole years . When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races , the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid , the other brainiac weaklings . Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production , and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen , while the Eloi were us , castrated professors educated out of our balls . Rod Taylor 's mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night . Yvette Mimieux is Weena , exquisitely elfin and needy , in her leaf-colored linen dress , falling for George HG Wells , Rod Taylor 's character despite her natural antipathy towards dark men . This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet , oddly enough , it is perfect for young children . Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time . Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy , all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks , pitied the Eloi , and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world . Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1 , 000 , 000 years from now where Weena waits for him ? It 's a treat on DVD , as are the special features and commentary , but Alan Young does n't seem to have a bit of shame in him ; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie .",m,1
"George Pal 's classic movie is a delight from begining to end , and , surprisingly , much closer to Well 's book than his great grandson 's lame remake , with much creepier Morlocks . The documentary on the DVD is a mixed bag , with great stuff about what has become of the machine itself , it 's rescue and restoration , and also odd stuff with Alan Young and Rod Taylor in a sequel scene that contradicts the movie . The documentary is dedicated to the memories of George Pal and Mike Minor , the latter a friend of mine who is much missed . Skip the remake and enjoy the original .",m,1
"I saw this movie when I was a kid and it stood with me ever since . I just love the film , the machine and the overall plot . It just keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know more as the movie unfold . The simple but yet clear scientifical explanation early on in the film is a great suspense setter . Overall : EXCELLENT .",m,1
"I saw this as a kid when I was at my grandma 's house and I really enjoyed it . I have watched it again as an adult and still find it to be just as entertaining . It 's about a man who builds a time machine and goes into the future . He finds humans and a mutant cannibalistic breed of humans who live underground and eat normal humans . He meets a very pretty woman named Weena and they and the others must confront the monsters . It has a great ending and though the special effects are VERY dated , it 's still really cool to see the time-lapse effect as he travels through the centuries . The movie is squeaky clean , has little kissing , mild action and is ok for most kids . It 's a little scary in some parts but the monsters look so cheesy it 's sort of funny . I find it really interesting to watch movies that my parents and grandparents saw . I think this movie is a classic and will be enjoyed for many more generations .",f,1
"Based on the famous novel of H . G . Wells , a young inventor constructs a device thatenables him to travel to the future , to see what the future will depart us . But this somber gaze has nothing to do with a promissory future where harmony and peace will reign . Regardless the spanning years , the film still strike you . Memorable special effects and imaginative stages , where the vigorous profile of Rod Taylor is admirably compensated with that sidereal beauty who Yvette Mimieux was . Georges Pal would eventually the same director of the famous cult movie : '' the seven faces of Dr . Lao . ``",m,1
"I 've had the Time Machine on VHS forever it seems . Taped it off the TV years ago . But when I saw this DVD , it blew me away ! I had NO IDEA ! Never have I seen every colour in his jacket , every grain of dirt , every hair on his head with such clarity . The time machine absolutely shines with beauty too . I sat with my jaw hanging open and goose bumps on my arms even as soon as the opening credits when I heard the surround sound kick in . My VHS copy always had a really bad audio track , but on the DVD , you can actually hear the faint electrical buzz of the machine running in the lab before he hits that crystal lever . I saw and heard things I never knew existed in this movie . And it has a fabulous documentary with it , hosted by Rod Taylor , that explains everything we always wondered like what happened to that little model of the machine that he put the cigar in , and the full scale machine itself has a story that you wo n't believe ! All in all , it 's a wonderful movie , and everything a DVD should be . Brilliant , vibrant , with gut vibrating audio . and still better than the remake that was just in theatres Fantastic !",f,1
"Great movie about a man who travels through time into the future , and then finds his lover who is absolutley beautiful in the year 800 , 000 . Buy this one , it 's a classic",m,1
THIS IS ONE OF H . G . WELLS CLASSICS . I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT . IT 'S JUST AS GOOD NOW AS IT WAS THEN . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE .,m,1
The Time Machine is a `` deep thought '' movie . This has always been a favorite of mine . I have watched it many times .,m,1
"The time machine was an excellent movie . I highly recommend it . Rod Taylor is a superb actor , and makes this movie a classic .",f,1
"There are a lot of reviews about this great picture and how it influenced an entire generation . All of it is true ! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder . We can thank Mr . Wells for creating the story , but we really owe it to George Pal , Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure . The real draw of course is & quot ; The Time Machine & quot ; prop . Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired . The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved . All of the elements of Victorian London in winter , cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner , & quot ; tea table & quot ; chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting . When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor . As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you can not help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention ! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a & quot ; cold war & quot ; interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the & quot ; future & quot ; on August 18th , 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust . From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture . The care that went into this DVD should not be understated . It is a highly polished film that restores 20 20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there . Once again , we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in , the clear sky above the Eloi & quot ; cafeteria & quot ; and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns . When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that & quot ; that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time & quot ; and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs . Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again , because you are in love with a romantic idea , TIME TRAVEL .",m,1
"The Time Machine had a great effect on me . I found it to be enjoyable and it had very fascinating theories throughout . What I liked most in the book was the interesting characters , H . G . Wells ' style of writing , the parallel of Eloi and Morlocks to society now , how the book always kept my attention , and finally I liked how the narrator left us questioning the conclusion of the novel . First , I liked how interesting the characters were simply because that is a vital aspect to a good novel . I was impressed by the Time Traveller , and how he was determined to prove his machine to be a success . The characters whom attended his dinners always seemed a little skeptical of his ideas and theories . The Time Traveller explains his discovery of the fourth-dimension and the Psychologist interrupts stating , & quot ; You can move about in all directions of space , but you can not move about in Time & quot ; III . 13 . 16 . The second thing I liked about the novel was the authors ' style of writing . Wells remained descriptive throughout the book . For a novel based on imagination and theories , I found it important that Wells had kept some reality in it . Reality being the descriptive details in the novel . With all these crazy ideas going on in the book , Wells had to keep our minds somewhat intact to what his visions were . The Time Traveller describes the Eloi 's as being & quot ; very beautiful and graceful creatures , but indescribably frail . His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive-that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much & quot ; III . 34 . 33 . Another aspect of the novel I enjoyed , was the parallel of the Eloi and Morlocks to society now . We begin to understand that the Eloi and Morlocks are humans after great evolution and time . It amazed me to see how society completely divided itself between graceful creatures and creatures of the underworld . The fourth thing I liked was how the book kept my attention the whole way through . I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next or how the Time Traveller was going to escape the Morlocks and get back to his machine . Finally , I really enjoyed how the narrator concludes the Time Travellers disappearance . The narrator says , & quot ; The Time Traveller vanished three years ago . And , as everybody knows now , he has never returned & quot ; XII . 124 . 18 . I liked this because it made you question whether the Time Traveller had vanished into the future forever , whether he had always been from a past time and had gone back , or what was to come of him ? So , as it began with one mans ' imagination , it ends with your own .",f,1
"This is a great anniversary edition of this sci-fi classic , however , the seller failed to do a quality check before shipping . The case was damaged inside and a piece of the plastic was rubbing on the recorded side od the DVD making scratches all over . The quality of the video was then , of course , damaged also . Lesson : check before you ship . I 'll reorder it , probably from a different supplier .",m,1

This is a great movie & has been updated considerably visually over the original . The quality of the image is much better & more clear . It 's the same original movie but even more enjoyable to watch now . The DVD I received is perfect quality for a used movie . I highly recommend used movies from Amazon . They are great to replace older movies on VCR tape . The prices are very good .,f,1
"This show is still one of the best movies I have ever enjoyed , top 5 , the book is great too , it is a true classic and a fantastic story ! ! I saw it at the old Avalon theater in Chicago , when it first came out , it was out of sight then & it still is . Good old memories . Enjoy it .",m,1
"Really Great to see this clasic again . Arrived in good time , no defects and good condition . thank you",m,1
"Excellent acting by Taylor , Young , Cabot , and Mimieux sp ? . Good sets and fine if now outdated story . To reviewer Michael Butts . Giant was directed by George Stevens , not George Pal .",f,1
"Director George Pal will probably be more remembered for this film than any of his other classics , including & quot ; Giant . & quot ; Why ? Remember , this is 1960 , and whether or not Pal 's version is true to Wells ' book is not the issue . Marvel at the unique special effects , including the mannequin 's many transformations , the way the clouds scurry across the window ; the lush but sterile world of the eloi and morlocks . This is quite groundbreaking in the world of cinema , long before the CGI and animatronics guys came along . Rod Taylor The Birds , TV 's Falcon Crest is the perfect studly hero , but he also possesses a sensitivity uncommon in movies of the 60s , which is all more evident in his friendship with the delightful Alan Young Tom Thumb , Mr . Ed . Add a trio of our most respected character actors Sebastian Cabot , Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore to lend upper crust credence . And how can one forget the lovely Yvette Mimieux . Yvette came to audiences attentions in a two part Dr . Kildare episode . She played his love interest , a surfer with elilepsy , who dies in the final moments . She also played the troubled young girl in & quot ; Where the Boys Are & quot ; and in the 1970s starred in a rarely known cult classic , & quot ; Hit Lady . & quot ; Her beautiful innocence is captured in this movie . Yes , it 's campy , a little corny in its naivete about man 's future , but as a scifi film , it 's one of the best and far surpasses its glitzy remake with Guy Pearce .",m,1
"THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC FROM THE SIXTIES . GOOD ACTION , WELL MADE , THEY DO N'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE",m,1
"Unlike the recent re-make this flows more of the book diologe . . . . I give it good acting credit , Alough I think it does kinda lack the classic touch but it was the good classic tech not the best but good Ide suggest renting it , buy it if you relly like it ! .",m,1
the stream was pixelated and kept on stopping and starting . There was no smooth stream . I tried to watch it at different times on 2 different computers same results,f,0
"Although quite different in tone and content from the original novel by H . G . Wells , George Pal 's Oscar winner for Special Effects , The Time Machine convincingly conveys the wonder and mystery of time travel . Rod Taylor 's highly believable and intense portrayal of the time traveler is a major strength of the film . Even though the special effects are & quot ; dated & quot ; and reveal at times the & quot ; effects & quot ; of low budget , they manage to hold up over repeated viewings much like Pal 's The War of the Worlds . The Victorian atmosphere of The Time Machine is as vivid as the strangeness of the world in 802 , 701AD . In spite of its genre ' , the film manages to effectively portray the need for preserving our human-ness throughout time . If the obvious adherence to Hollywood comic book rescue adventure and romance are given poetic license , the film is still very unique , entertaining , and worth having in one 's film library .",m,1
"The Time Machine is a Science Fiction classic . George Pal too H . G . Wells & # 65533 ; s classic story and made it a reality . From the costumes to the intricately detailed Time Machine itself , the movie is a stand out in special effects , art direction and make-up . < p > Rod Taylor was fantastic and played his character with a real sense of amazement . If you have seen the new version & # 65533 ; it lacks a real important element & # 65533 ; characters anyone cares about . This movie has a charm and romance that Yvette Mimoeux could only portray . < p > Even George Pal & # 65533 ; s visions of what the 80 & # 65533 ; and 90 & # 65533 ; s would be like are not far off . Who could forget the classic mannequin in the window sequence & # 65533 ; watching fashion styles change before our eyes . The key to most of the special effects in the film was of course & # 65533 ; stop motion animation . Whereby , elements and props and sets are shot one frame at a time while slight movements were made between each exposed frame . Thanks to CGI technology these days & # 65533 ; this has almost become a lost art form . When it is done well , like in this movie & # 65533 ; it really is effective and shines . < p > The DVD extras on this one are great . A television retrospective shot in the mid 90 & # 65533 ; s with some of the original cast is really well done . The behind the scenes and event he history of what happened to the original Time Machine are on this documentary . < p > This is a must DVD for Science Fiction fans . A true classic and a very good DVD for anyone 's collection .",m,1
"George Pal 's films have always had a warm and fuzzy feeling - except this one . However , how else would such a creative genius and pioneer in stop-motion approach such a bleak story but with a hopeful tone . The charactors - Alan Young 's Mr . Philby stands out - add flesh to the Victorian era story of an inventor who could easily destroy the world , but winds up possibly saving mankind from itself . The special effects were good for their time and the acting pretty much stands up and Yvette Mimmieux looks fabulous ! but the story and the kindly treatment by Mr . Pal are everything .",m,0

The Time Machine . . . his first and best work !",m,1
"Skip the godawful remake that 's in theaters right now , and get the original instead . This is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time , and the DVD restoration is great . < p > The movie itself has much to recommend it . It follows the book very closely , Rod Taylor was an excellent choice for the lead , and the special effects which won an Oscar in 1960 have aged surprisingly well . < p > It takes place in 1899 , and a great deal of effort was taken to ensure historic authenticity . The time machine itself is a beautiful Victorian contraption that would n't look out of place in , say , 12 Monkeys . The Eloi of the 800k century look exactly as I would have pictured them , and the Morlocks are suitably creepy . < p > Much has been said for the special effects , which use some very effective stop-action photography . They are judiciously used here , and with only a couple of tiny exceptions , do a great job of suspending disbelief . < p > The DVD transfer is stunning , rivaling that of North by Northwest . The colors originally done using Metrocolor are deeply saturated and vivid , only looking slightly washed out in a couple of places . Artifacts from the original print are present here and there noticeably in the rotting fruit sequence , but for the most part have been well cleaned up . This certainly does n't look like a 40-year-old movie . < p > The DVD includes a documentary which is really interesting in parts , but really drags in others the special effects explanations are *exhaustive* , which is n't a problem since it has its own chapter stops . What 's really informative is to watch the original movie footage in the documentary and compare it to the restored footage in the movie itself . Night and day . Oh yeah , and Michael J . Fox and Carl Sagan make appearances ! < p > All in all , a classic movie that 's aged well , and a brilliant transfer to match .",m,1
"I always loved this movie since the first time I saw it when I was 6 years old . I remember taking a small toy car and sticking a little umbrella in the back to make it look like the Time Machine . < p > This DVD is really incredible ! What they did to the soundtrack is great . The movie sounds great in 5 . 1 and remember this movie is a 40 year old movie . FOX should have taken lessons before the did Planet of the Apes in 5 . 1 if you can call it that ! < p > Picture quality is superb . But I do agree with another reviewer that the DVD cover could have been better , but I do see that another BOX set version of this movie is coming out this month with alot more goodies !",m,1
"The 1960 film version of `` The Time Machine '' , was always one of my absolute favourites growing up and rewatching it now as an adult I appreciate now even more the great effort put in by the legendary George Pal and his talented cast and technical crew in bringing this story vividly to life . Their attention to detail , and creation of what are still awe inspiring special effects were of course created using their collective imaginations without the help of today 's computers . I 'm not going into exclamations as others have about the effects appearing `` dated '' , by today 's standards as that is a pointless exercise and really why is there a need to compare efforts such as this made in 1960 with the technology available to movie makers today ? I look at the film in the context of the time it was made in and in this way it can be seen that `` The Time Machine '' , was very state of the art entertainment upon its release . Using the excellent literary source in the famous novel by H . G . Wells , MGM studios in a last gasp of its famous move making finesse fashioned an exciting , thought provoking , and above all else spectacular story here that looks as fresh today as it did over 45 years ago . What is so totally impressive about this film version still for me is the marvellous depiction of the passage of time once the story gets under way and this progression by Rod Taylor on his time machine from New Years Eve 1899 through many thousands of years into Earth 's future is still one of the greatest science fiction sequences ever filmed in any decade . George Pal 's brilliance in visual design is wonderfully evident in every frame of these scenes where he shows the passing of time by the continual speeded up rising and setting of the sun and moon and best of all by a wonderful idea of continually showing the clothes on a mannequin standing in a neighboring shop window continually changing as the fashions progress over many decades . The time machine itself is a wonderful piece of movie making design and in the decades since the film 's release has really taken on a whole life of its own as probably one of the most famous movie props ever created . For all sci fi film lovers like myself this wonderful piece of imaginative construction along with the whole classic movie to which it belongs has assumed an appropriately timeless quality and illustrates yet again the genius that was movie maker George Pal .",m,1
"In the 1960 's , when movie making was still an art form , master puppeteer , George Pal created what has been considered a true classic , The Time Machine . Selecting as his hero , the handsome , gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor , playing Herbert George Wells , the director accurately portrays the adventurous , but moody , Victorian as a gentleman , who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date , Pal launches Taylor into the future . Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons , Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi . Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena Yvette Mimieux and her people . During their brief time together , Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic paradise , it is not without dangers . In this future , it 's the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells ' time machine . Doomed to spend eternity in the future , Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby Alan Young and his Victorian friends . The film is superb and despite being remade several times , has never been equaled . H . G . Wells would have approved . *****",m,1
"`` The Time Machine '' , is one of the many movies that when it was made was in danger of not living up to the expectations of many . There were those who love H . G . Wells and wanted an acurate portrayal of his work . There were those who liked science fiction and fantasy movies and wanted it to fit into that segment of cinema . It was going to be difficult to please everyone , but amazingly it did . The idea of using time travel in movies has been done and redone ; I think of the movies `` Back to the Future '' , `` Peggy Sue got Married '' , and many many more , but for me this is one of the better done ones , because1st . The movie talks about searching for a greater good . It 's not just a story of humor , or vaneness , or someone trying to get out of trouble . In other words , there is much more at stake in this movie . It 's a movie about one man searching for answers that are bigger than himself . I can totally relate to this . Let me be honest and say this is a thinking mans movie . Yes , you can just simply watch and enjoy , but if that is all you do you have missed out on so much . We are meant to watch this movie , and then meditate on it . To see ourselves in the characters . 2nd . the director could have made this movie in a number of ways , but the direction is superb , and I loved the special effects . The scenes when the inventor is still in his lab watching the first half of the 20th century go by is great ! I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette on the movie that is presented by Rod Taylor . The part of what happened to the actual machine after the movie is both interesting and sad . This movie is leaps and bounds better than the newer version of `` The Time Machine '' . Do n't miss this jewel .",m,1
A good movie for it 's time and a good movie now . So much better than the cheesy remake .,m,1
For old time classic sci-fi it does n't get any better than this . I remember watching this film as a boy and it 's still great even now . Please remember that the special effects are not as sophisticated as they are today but the story line and characters are great . An added bonus is that the digitally enhanced version for DVD is `` OUTSTANDING '' ! This picture is as crisp and clear as it gets and is hard to believe the film itself was made in 1960 . The special bonus features are also equally excellent with a few of the original stars of the film appearing some 30 years later with some neat surprises about the film . If you like science fiction than this film is a `` Must Have '' .,m,1
"Well , I think that this was probably the only movie I ever watched as a junior high and high school student . At least it seemed this way . And I was addicted to the book -- reading it in the bathtub , etc . But that is a different review ! < p > My only copy was a static-ladened VCR tape I got off of the local UHF . It was absolutely stunning to see the film in a clear letter-boy , plus to see the missing scenes that were cut out due to time constraints . Wonderful ! < p > Yes the effects are cheesy , and WWIII in 1966 is dated , but still . . . give it a break . & quot ; 1984 & quot ; was off , but we still read the book ! < p > This DVD has the complete film , and it is a good transfer , except for one or two scenes which seem a little fuzzy . The sound is tops ! < p > The great bonus was the & quot ; Making of . . . & quot ; This segment is a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie , with a special segment ! Rod Taylor George and Alan Young Filby filmed an addendum to the film , and it is an almost perfect continuation and conclusion to the film ! < p > This was the first DVD I ever owned . I love it ! Just the thought of traveling thorough time appeals to me . that is probably why I am a historian !",m,1
"The first thing I have to say about the film is that it tries to follow the book up to a point . But in order to make a film for the big screen they had to add just a detail here and there and , of course , a love interest . With actors like Rod Taylor , Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux in a film by George Pal you really ca n't go wrong . Actions , adventure , special effects ! The extra is a long feature mostly focused on the Time Machine , how it was made and what happened to it during and after the film . A must for any fan of H . G . Wells and sci-fi .",m,1
"Back in the mid 1960 's we were given a glimpse into the future courtesy of George Pal . The oscar winning film still manages to stir the imaginaion after all these years . For fans of the movie it doesnt get better than this . The film transfer is shown in its theatrical widescreen version and is digitally mastered from the original print . Included is a making of documentary hosted by Rod Taylor and can also be heard in 5 . 1 surround sound . I would have given this DVD a 5 star rating had they included some deleted scenes , and possibly an isolated music score . Sure its no Terminator 2 as far as special effects , but as far as story goes it still manages to keep me wanting to go up to the attic and get out my legos and erector sets and build a time machine of my own .",m,1
"What a great movie . Rod Taylor Takes HG Well 's George the main charactor through time . He tries to find a better world . Yet as far as you can go things remain the same . The special effects for the 60 's was great . HG Wells was showing how he felt about society . Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks . Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book . This movie was charming , exciting and a true classic . See it .",m,1
A thousand times better than the recent remake . Do n't bother with that one . This is the definitive movie . I watched this with my 22 year old daughterwho is studying animation . She agreed with me that George Pal 's 1960 animationwas as good as anything in the new version . The story was far better presented . and the additional 30 minute special feature with brings Rod Taylor and Alan Youngback together again 30+ years later was far more enjoyable than most 'making of'features .,m,1
"I saw this as a boy and it permanently entered my imagination . If there was one wish that I could have had , it would have been to have a real machine like the one in the film . I added the film to my collection so that I could share it with my children . Watching it at this age , I must say that there is still magic to it . In particular , the sense of history passing so quickly , seeing where the path of man might lead . The scientist truly still captured my imagination - his inspiration , his wonder , his hopes , his regrets , his struggle against smaller minds . That part worked for me as it did in 1964 , when I first saw it . I also enjoyed his discovery and investigation of the Eloi , who to his horror had devolved into passive children living only in the present , using only present-tense verbs . Unfortunately , the part with the Morlocks appeared preposterous and crude to me , a kind of tack-on to the great first hour of the movie , to make it an action movie in its last 25 minutes . It is fun , of course , but there is nothing distinguished about it and the end resolution is way too pat . And my kids g14 & b10 . With the special effects nearly 50 years old , they were not impressed . They also did not get swept up in the themes the way I did , again with a mix of sophistication and impatience with the slower pace the Star Wars infection , I would call that . But we did discuss it , even if they laughed at it for the most part . The extras of my edition are also OK . Though the documentary has too much about the fate of the prop time machine , there is also a fictional vignette conclusion that is truly worth the price of admission . Warmly recommended . I guess I 'm dated in my kids ' eyes , but I am still a sucker for it and glad of it !",m,1
I have been searching for this very version of this title for quite a long time . I owe the newer version of this film & I find it to be a very Poor remake of a very great Classic movie .,m,1
"This time travelling tale is getting quite old , but is still fineentertainment that will stir the imagination . Saw this movie around 40years ago and even if some stuff is outdated , it still holds my attention .",m,1
"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid , and have watched it at least thirty times since , it had a great impact on my life . The special effects leave a little to be desired , compared to a 'modern ' flick , but it 's a classic that belongs in everyone 's movie library .",m,1
"I 'm one of the few aged souls who first saw this in a theatre when it was first released . But , I 've also seen it several times since on VHS . I 'm new to DVD so I can neither praise nor criticize the techno dis- or advantages of that new medium . < p > I 've read the H . G . Wells novella several times and , like most people , I guess , have occasional fantasies of time travel . Years after I 'd first seen the film , I had a minor criticism , that the novella had more `` socialist '' undertones . The Eloi and the Morlocks had parted special ways due to economic oppression , i . e . , the latter being imprisoned in mines and factories so long that they became a troglyditic , brutal , predatory species while the former were weak , meek , ignorant , and the prey of the Morlocks . The film depoliticized that to a degree . < p > In retrospect , that depoliticization forgive the long word may have been necessary for the movie market of the time . The anti-communist fervor still existed then . What 's more , to make the story more meaningful to the young viewers , the producers and screen writers may have left out that which seemed more appropriate to Wells ' time . < p > And there WAS politics , appropriate to the time . For instance , the air raid alarm went off and the Eloi went into a trance to march to the dinner tables of the Morlocks . In other words , the original meaning of that alarm had been lost after thousands of centuries of distortion . < p > The characters were adequate , though I still find it hard to see Rod Taylor as an Englishman . Other leading characters went on to roles such as the lead human character in `` Mr . Ed , `` and Giles French , the genial butler in `` Family Affair . `` In any event , the special effects were superbly done , the story well executed . I could criticize the simplistic romance of Yvette Mimieux 's character , but the rest of the story overshadowed that . And , as others have pointed out , there was a challenge to `` realism , `` what one would expect after 8000 centuries . But the `` li cense of the medium , `` and the points of the story make up for those weaknesses . Neither Wells nor the producers intended historical realism . < p > And one can not help but be amused by the futurist speculation , e . g . , a nuclear war beginning in 1966 . Again , that was a overwhelming fear in the year the film was made and seemed all too possible . < p > Because I 've so loved this film for the last 42 ! years , I asked my wife for the soundtrack and for the `` remake '' if that 's what it is from Amazon . com for Christmas . When I get them , perhaps I 'll add a couple more reviews on these pages . For now , I think this film is a classic , and I still recommend the novella .",m,1
"It 's about time ! No pun intended . I saw this on TV when I was less than 10 years old , and I never forgot it - the image of that Victorian design time machine with the revovling disk is burned into my head . Imagine my joy when I saw it being used as the time machine in Carl Sagan 's COSMOS TV series now *there's* another that deserves DVD treatment . George Pal outdoes himself , with an story that 's surprisingly faithtful to the spirit of the original Wells novel - with romance , adventure , and visions of the future thrown in , right down to a nuclear war in the 1980s and lava filling the streets . One of the best things about the DVD format is the behind the scenes features you can tag onto classic movies - sadly , not all movie releases do this . Where 's the commented versions of War of the Worlds , Forbidden Planet - and when can we get The Day The Earth Stood Still and When Worlds Collide ? Come on - there 's tons of us SF movie geeks out there . Feed us !",m,1
Maybe it 's because I think of this version as the standard against which all other Time Machine movies must be compared . I just enjoy it . It was a great introduction to the idea of relativity for my 8th graders . They really got into it .,m,1
The Time Machine 1960 was an excellent five star movie produced by George Pal starring Rod Taylor . This old movie has held up pretty well with the passage of much time . I first saw it at the Loews Paradise in the Bronx back in 1960 . Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film . Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective . The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story .,m,1
"Boy , did a nice DVD transfer like this one not only make me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better , too , for some reason . I only acquired the DVD as a memento , so to speak . I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s : Yvettte Mimieux . She still looks great , too . Since time travel stories also fascinate me , my favorite part of the film is when `` George '' Rod Taylor is actually in his time machine and experiments with it , slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII . Then , he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack . Apparently , scare-mongers back in '60 thought that was a short-term likelihood . Anyway , when `` George '' H . G . Wells , the author of this story finally stops , in the year 200 , 000-something , the story loses some of its momentum . However , it 's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people . Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed . The message I got on this last look is that man is still man , meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good , and to put one 's faith totally in man is a mistake . It 's only going to lead to disappointments as `` George '' found out on each of his stops . Notice he never stopped during a peaceful , progressive period . Yet , `` George '' is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better . There 's always hope for a better world and people like George , with his idealism put to action , can make a difference . Overall , an entertaining and thought-provoking film .",m,1
"`` The Time Machine '' is as far as I 'm concerned George Pal 's best movie . Released in 1960 , it stars Rod Taylor as the time traveler `George ' . George is an inventor in 1899 . In an gathering of his friends , he demonstrates a scale model of what he says is a time machine . Except for his friend Filby played by a finely nuanced Alan Young those gathered do n't believe him . Unsuspected by all but Filby , George has built a full-scale model . After his guests leave , he 's off . . . . . . . The set design is brilliant . The time machine itself is the coolest thing made by genuine imitation Hollywood Victorian craftsman . A nice touch is the nameplate on the control panel . It says , `` Built by H . George Wells '' . The special effects were state-of-the-art for 1960 winning an Academy Award for best special effects . Even today , the effects fit neatly into the story . This is a mid-twentieth century cinematic interpretation of a nineteenth century novel . The David Duncan screenplay `updates ' the story brilliantly . While George Pal 's films have a well-deserved reputation for technical excellence , the acting has been uneven . That is not the case in this movie . Mr . Taylor is totally believable as the idealistic inventor searching for a better world . Yvette Mimieux is Weena , of the sheep-like Eloi who begins to think as result of meeting George . The DVD I have has an excellent documentary on the making of the film narrated by Mr . Taylor . If you interested in a great SF adventure movie , this one is essential to your collection .",m,1

"Both Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in their perfomrances in this movie , though for Watanabe san it was mere rotuine for him since he has regularly played such roles in his native homeland of Japan . His skills as a Samurai in this movie shined brightly and I was also taken by his english speaking capability . Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his . After seeing other movies of his I was somewhat disappointed by his perfomrances . After purchasing a book about the making of this movie , it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations , costume design , history of the Samurai and other details . From reading this it not only shows that Tom Cruise put forth countless hours in preparing for this movie as an actor and at the same time displaying respect for the Japanese culture . < p > Special mention undoubtedly goes to both Koyuki and newcomer to me Hiroyuki Sanada . Though I have never seen Hiroyuki san myself while I was in Japan for the last eleven years , his performance fell nothing short of spectacular . As for Koyuki san , most of her roles in Japan have been those of Japanese dramas where she obvioulsy speaks her native tounge . In `` The Last Samurai '' she shows that she is able to gain your undivided attention not only by her beauty , but by her presence even if she does not have many speaking roles . < p > For those who do not understand the Japanese culture much at all , `` The Last Samurai '' can and will shed some light for you in not only understanding but appreciating the culture as well . < p > I intend not only to view this movie numerous times when I wish to view great perfomrances by these actors , but to also take me back to a country which I fell in love with while I was there .",m,1
"The last Samurai is a very good film that falls just short of being great . That should not take away from the fact that it is one of the year 's ten best films or that it contains one of the year 's better performances in the form of Ken Watanbe , whose portrayal of a loyal Samurai leader is amazing as he draws you in to his world and culture . You can see why Tom Cruise follows him into his ways . This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance . The only problem I have with this film is how self important it is . Even films of this magnitude should not tug so hard on the epic strings . We get the point that this is a big historical epic . No need to keep implying it . However , this film is still worthy of some awards and a good audience .",m,1
"This film seems to have been constructed around Cruise to polish his , some might say , fading star . He 's allowed to chew scenery and over-act with abandon in almost every scene . I did n't believe for a second he was an alcoholic . His screaming `` Sake '' throughout his withdrawl scene was so obnoxious , I really could n't believe it , and was actually embarrassed to watch it . When he gets beat down by the Samurai with the staff , I really could n't believe Zwick and co . would use the ole 'they ca n't beat this man down ' cliched faux character exposition posturing . Again , my embarrassment grew as the overbearing score swelled . And right , surely the kids of the fallen Samurai would just love ole 'whitey'- I mean , he only killed their dad . Did anyone think for a second our American Movie Hero would n't nab the widowed Samurai 's wife - made a widow at the hands of Cruise ? Please . I give this film 2 stars only for Ken Watanabe 's performance and some nice cinematography . If Zwick will be kissing anymore Hollywood star behind in his future films , I only hope he gives us advance warning so I can avoid those movies like the plague . And Tom , gee . . . I have no advice for you . I am simply still dumbfounded at your performance here . I am reminded of Jon Lovitz in that old SNL skit . `` Acting , Genius . . . Thank you ! ! ! ! ! ``",m,0
Great battle scenes never seen in this scale . Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb .,m,1
"Okay , first off I want to say that this was a great movie , great acting and directing , great battle scenes and beautiful Japanese scenery . Many people say this is Dances With Wolves , yes the plot is slightly the same , but I watched Dances With Wolves , I have almost never watched such a boring movie , If The Last Samurai is this , it is certainly a much less boring version . And many people complain about how Tom Cruise doesnt die at the end , well 'It was not his time ' as Katsumoto explained numerous times in the movie . And the reason the children and Taka fall in love with Tom is that they forgave him for killing their father husband , they beleived they where both warriors that did their duty on the field , and they certainly believed that their way of life was worth fighting for . I would think that the way of the samurai or Bushido was worth fighting for , especially back then . As Tom said 'What could be more necissary ? '",m,1
"This is , without a doubt , the most underrated movie of 2003 . This is Edward Zwick 's crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise 's best performance if he had n't been in `` Born on the 4th of July '' . I enjoyed `` Master and Commander '' but it is so 2nd rate to this . This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain , scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops , who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people the samurai , who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds . When his old American comrades come to bring down the samurai , he does all he can to defend them . It is similar to `` Dances with Wolves '' and `` Lawrence of Arabia '' in that it is about a depressed man who changes his ways . But I think that this movie is ultimately superior to them . Another thing , the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking , another reason to see this movie . This movie deserved the 10 oscar nominations `` Master & Commander '' recieved including best picture .",m,1
"For many western viewers , this may be the first `` samurai '' film that they have watched with only a vague and rudiamentary knowledge of who the samurai were , what they symbolized , and how they arose and declined in power . The more one knows about the samurai , the more `` phoney '' this film appears to be . Make no mistake , this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai . This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo . There 's an early scene in the movie `` SHOGUN '' where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai . I watched Kurosawa 's `` RAN '' before watching `` THE LAST SAMURAI '' in the cinema where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers . `` THE LAST SAMURAI '' looks good visually , but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise 's egotism and Hollywood 's cliches and obligatory plot devices such as the weak `` happy '' ending . Nonetheless , this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today 's technocratic Japan . By the way , Japan 's new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines . The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled . On the other hand , it 's a Hollywood film where it is too commercially risky to cast Tom Cruise as a German officer named `` Fritz '' who drowns his sorrows in shnapps instead of whisky .",m,0
"Last Samurai is no masterpiecebut technically it isthe visuals , the sound effects , the music . If you want to show off to your friends what a great hi-def system you got , purchase this movie . If you want a classic , but lord of the rings or gone with the wind instead .",f,1
"After picking up my HD DVD player I 've had troubles watching regular DVD movies . I had heard some good things about this movie but could n't pass it up once it was in high definition . The story is pretty good . This is the story of Captain Algren who has been sent to Japan in the late 1800 's in order to help them modernize the Japanese army as they go from fighting with swords and arrows to machine guns and cannons . After the `` modern '' Japanese army prematurely attacks the Samurai and lose horribly , Captain Algren is taken captive by the Samurai and introduced to their way of life and refusal to lay down the sword in the name of compliance . In time , Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life . The story is pretty good but what raises this up to the level of being outstanding is the high definition quality of the movie . It was fantastic , especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence . If you like Tom Cruise action movies , this is one to pick up especially in high definition whether it be Blu-Ray or HD DVD . The violence can be extremely graphic hey , this is war so if you are sensitive to that you may want to look for something else . Otherwise , the pacing of the movie is pretty good . It is n't an all out gore-fest . . . there is action and then it breaks and lets you relax and catch up a little bit and then goes back to action and so on and so forth .",m,1
"Tom Cruise 's character comes off as a man who has seen violence from the time the doctor slapped his butt . War does things to soldiers that nobody else can understand or comprehend . The music is impressive , especially before the large battle . I feel goosebumps everytime I watch it . From the Cruise Samurai entrance to the emperor receiving the sword . Go for it .",m,1
"Okay , so the plot is just Dances with Wolves set in Japan . I still thought it looked glorious and that Tom is becoming a fine actor and that Ken Watanabe was fantastic ! For the length of the film , you 're transported back in time 100 years and get a wonderful taste of the period . The sword fights are wonderful , especially one where Tom 's character is set upon by four samurai . Usually , a Hollywood film showing the hero fighting against multiple attackers looks extremely corny : with each one waiting his turn to charge . This one looked quite a bit more compelling . When we saw it in the theater there was an audible & quot ; Whoa ! & quot ; from the audience when it was over . < p > This is n't The Godfather , but if you get it for a trip back in time complete with lush costumes and thrilling swordplay , this is a great ride !",m,1
"The Last Samurai is a showcase for Tom Cruise and he does a credible job of portraying Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who is haunted by his role in the slaughter of native Americans at the Battle of Little Big Horn . He is hired to train the & quot ; modern & quot ; Japanese army in defense of Samurai warriors who persist in rebelling against modernization of the Japanese culture . Cruise warns that his troops are not ready for battle and his prediction proves to be correct when he is defeated and captured . He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways . They return him to his people , but he begins to see that nobility lies with the Samurai and not with those who are trying to modernize Japan . It is all quite simplistic and the characters are pretty much stereotyped . There are lots of battle scenes , but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer . There are tears shed , but they are all shed by the actors and not the viewers . This is an epic film which fails to be a great one .",f,0
"The story is about a man haunted by his past in being part of a massacre of an Indian tribe . He ca n't sleep quietly since he is punished by nightmares about how he was forced to be and participate in something he clearly saw as wrong but had no other choice . Simply put this character is another poor life destroyed by war . < p > He is hired by the Japanese to train the Imperial Army in the occidental ways at a time a week emperor allows his advisors to forget tradition an import the ways of `` more advanced civilizations '' . In the process , the man gets captured by the samurai and during this captivity he begins not only to learn about their ways and philosophy , but also has peace for the first time in many years . < p > The Costume Design is incredibly accurate and the cinematography is absolutely superb . The music by Hans Zimmer is just beautiful , like another Gladiator epic . This movie is for people who love those little details . The production is really ambitious and works to deliver an astonishing view . This DVD is really promising with features like the `` History vs . Hollywood : The Last Samurai History Channel Documentary '' If you like this kind of movie where characters find themselves with a simpler but deeper view of life and appreciate a superb production , then this movie is certainly going to give you a very good three hours .",m,1
"You may think I am joking but Honestly , I enjoyed this movie from start to finish . I have found so many movies so boring of late that I just doze off during the performance . This movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes . Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout .",m,1
Beautifully filmed with a plot that truly touches the heart . The cast chosen were oerfect and the theme was good . No regrets ! Wating for the DVD to be released . A sure buy thing . I wanted to go watch it the 3rd time .,m,1
"The Last Samurai : 8 out of 10 : I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations . The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable . The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene . Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life . And what a life . Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody . Like Robert Redford 's take on Montana in `` Legends of the Fall '' , every view is spectacular , every sunset is orange , every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best . You would n't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment . Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree . Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted . Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did . Yet the picture despite one or two faults works . The acting , with one exception is uniformly excellent . The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good . On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson . The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope . His strangely self effacing dialogue does n't help his cause , yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy . In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout . I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie .",m,1
"Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren , an American soldier who has become disillusioned with his life he starts to regret the fact that the only thing he is good at seems to be killing . He reluctantly accepts a position to train an army of Japanese transcripts to use Western fighting techniques to combat the Samurai . He is ultimately captured by the Samurai , who need him as a source of information about their enemy . < p > As a captive of the Samurai , Nathan learns the ways of the Samurai and their people , and eventually learns to respect their philosophy about honor and service .",m,1
"The Last Samurai is a great movie , good story , very entertaining . I 'd recommend seeing this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD if you have n't seen it yet . < p > This movie is not a study in phenomenology and existential philosophy , but a good movie that made tears come to my eyes and that does n't happen too often . < p > I thought this movie was better than the Lord of the Rings , though I 'd guess that that comes from actually reading the books .",m,1
"I 'm actually surprised how anyone can bash this film , although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why . The bashers : one , someone who hates Samurai , and knows obviously NOTHING of Bushido ! While the other who loves the term Gaikokujin , which is akin to foreigner for the none-Japanese literate , apparently this `` reviewer '' is upset and angry with his own bad luck with asian women and so decides to rant furiously against a great film . It 's not a `` cliched notion '' as he calls it . Captain Nathan Algren not only nearly saved her life , but is symbolic to the Zen Way . He killed her husband , and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film . < p > Now , with those two mixed up reviewers tossed out of the mix , I wish to present to you an objective opinion . < p > The movie was great . I loved it . My favorite film ever , and I can saw that is alot coming from me , as I am a very cultured viewer . That is not to say you might not like it , as much of the film is in Japanese , and you would need to be open-minded to embrace it as I have . I personally , went in skeptically . I do n't particularly like Tom Cruise 's last performances . In specific , Mission Impossible 2 , and all the other movies where it focuses solely on him . It 's different in this movie . Tom Cruise contains his ego , and gives other people surprisingly proportionate roles . He was a hardened battle veteran , but still the movie shows that it was not his skill , as another reviewer whined about , that was great , but his perserverance . < p > I do n't want to spoil the movie , so go watch it ! It 's my personal favorite ever , `` and that 's saying a lot '' *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers , watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this , and still this one tops it off . Purely magnificent . A work of art .",m,1
"This film is a must see ! ! ! Tom reaches deep down for the emotions expressed in this film . You feel every ounce of his anguish and regret for the terrible things he 's done in his war days . I agree with the critics something I rearely do . . . when they say this film is of epic porportions . . . . . This film moved me very deeply , but it also had a touch of humor here and there . . just enough . I ca n't wait until it 's released so I can see it again ! ! ! !",f,1
"I have loved this movie since it was first released and have the original DVD release which I have watched several times . Most all the reviews I see here are either for the Standard DVD and focus on the great story line and acting but not the quality of the DVD itself . Yes , Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and , yes , Ken Watanabe steals the show but let 's move on . So this one will focus on the Blu-ray DVD 's quality . Bought the Blu-ray version from Amazon and it was delivered post haste . When I first looked at the back cover information I was disappointed that the audio was Dolby Digital 5 . 1 rather than a lossless DTSHD 5 . 1 , almost thought of returning it before even watching but am glad I kept it . The video quality of the movie is fairly pristine with no artifacting , good details in the shadows and a sparkling clear transfer . While the audio quality is not the higher end DTSHD , never the less , the audio engineers did a fine job with the front and rear surrounds used subtly for action actually , during the battle scenes , the rears deserved more discreet use of the rear channels however , during the rainy scenes , of which there are many , the audio is evenly spread to all channels enveloping you in the rainstorm . The many extras on the single disc are from the 2004 standard release and there are only 2 deleted scenes that , to me , could have been included in an extended version . I wish more extended deleted scenes had been included . The supplied extras were all interesting and , as I said before , had seen them on the original release so nothing new on that front . Should you buy this on Blu-ray ? Yes , the video quality is definitely superior , however , not by that much . The original release was pretty darn good . However , if you do n't already have the Standard version , go for the Blu Ray . I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film . Hopefully , this review has been of help and , if so , please check the 'Helpful ' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you . Thanks .",m,1
"The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren Cruise , a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai , and Samurai leader Katsumoto Watanabe , who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly . Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai , but after spending a number of months as their captive , subsequently finds peace in their way of life . Eventually , he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against . Not only is the plot interesting and original , but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing . Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort , which I consider his best ever . Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto , commanding even more attention than Cruise , and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles . Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka , Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio , and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham . The execution of the battle scenes was excellent . This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts . As seen in the extras , the progression of Cruise 's skills with a sword is n't staged , either . Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision . Having seen this film a dozen times , I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing , either . The ones I have noticed are hidden well , and none of them take away from the film in any way . There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable , but overall the script is very well written . Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes , and he does it well . What really makes the movie , on top of everything else , is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer . Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little , this one is unique and powerful . The Last Samurai 's historical accuracy is n't as poor as some reviewers would suggest , but it is a work of fiction . On the special edition of this DVD , 2 deleted scenes are included , along with `` the filming of '' one of the scenes , and `` the filming of '' the Cruise beheading scene . There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan . All in all , The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film . The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars , and it has become one of my all time favorite movies .",m,1
"When I watch a movie that I enjoy , I 'll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath . If I can find more depth and meaning each time , I consider it more than just a film , it becomes a teaching about life . Such is my finding for this exceptional movie . It offers up a wide variety of important , even vital , lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved . The writing , directing , acting , locations , depth of meaning are all most excellent ! In today 's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life . A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment . The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life , honor , purpose , self sacrifice , and pure , love . While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time , I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece . I suggest to the viewer , that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine . The point is to take your time with this film , sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it 's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions , and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also , what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of `` life in every breath . ``",m,1
"This movie succeeds in its primary objective : it entertains . There is a solid story here that engages the viewer , moves at a smart pace , and never drags . Nor is this a shallow shoot-'em-up . There is a fascinating overarching theme here : the transformation of Japan into a modern , industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society , i . e . the Samurai , will not easily fit into the new order of things . While this film has historical inaccuracies , it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration , which is what this film is about . The Japanese are portrayed respectfully , and I think accurately , in this film . The sets and scenery , by the way , in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie , and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV as I did . Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film , and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years . In my opinion , however , Ken Wantanabe , as the main Japanese protagonist , dominates every scene he was in , leaving the viewer wishing for more . I have noticed this about Cruise and other big-star films -- the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene . Nothing against Cruise , but a little less would have been more , because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent , and I would have liked to have seen more of them . Overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once . RJB .",m,1
My favorite element of this movie is Tom Cruise as modern man finding Solace in the ancient ways of Japan . It is a powerful analogy which explores what it means to be succesful in society and what it means to be a modern man . Something I often wonder about while thinking of my legacy .,m,1
"There 's something about Zen and Samurai that I enjoy . Oh yeah ! They kick butt in this movie ! Tom Cruise is a very crappy actor these days but I think this has been his best performance in a long time . He plays a Union soldier who slaughtered Native Americans and has flashbacks of the war with the Indians . Well , he 's asked to go to Japan and help train Japnese soldiers to erase their history of the Samurai , and in again Tom Cruise is faced with the same situation as the weak Japanese military he 's helping to create has a mission to wipe the Samurai at the request of the emperor . The story is simple . Tom Cruise goes to battle with the soldiers he has trained who have n't had really much training , kills a Samurai in battle , gets captured , is held hostage , and his captors treat him as a guest in their village . He is nursed back to health after a battle wound by the family of the man he killed and he goes through several flashbacks of the battles with Native Americans he seems to wonder if it was the right thing or not . He conquers his alcohol addiction and learns the way of the Samurai warrior . This tale is very touching because of the Zen way of life the Samurai have . He killed one of their own , and then is accepted as one of them and fights along side of them to prove themselves worthy of their honor . I still ca n't believe it was Tom Cruise in this movie , if only he could do more similar things to The Last Samurai .",m,1
"Don & # 8217 ; t have to say much here . This is an action film in the no-tongue-in-check , classic sense , of films like & # 8220 ; In the Line of Fire , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Rob Roy , & # 8221 ; and so on , a true action film . Absolutely worth watching and owning . It is one of Cruise & # 8217 ; s best performances . I just wish there were more films like this . Empowering . -- Michael Erlewine , Founder of the All-Movie Guide allmovie . com",m,1
"This movie , was incredible , simply put . Such a mix of romance and honor , all beautifully blended together . Tom Cruise does a WONDERFUL job in this film , playing a troubled man who took part in killing innocent indian tribes , who takes a job in Japan training japanese soldiers who would be trained to supress rebel forces led by Samurai Katsumoto , who believed that Japan was progressing into modern culturization too fast , and resisted political advisors that were urging the Emperor to do just that , become more western , and modern . Katsumoto 's tribe of Samurai defeat the unit led by Capt Algren Cruise and capture him . He is held in captivity with the Samurai , and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there . He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village , and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto . In the battle preceding his capture , Algren kills Samurai Horutoru , Katsumoto 's brother in law , and his caretaker Kata 's husband . During his time in this village , Kata is repulsed by Algren , troubled with the death of her husband . As cruise learns the ways of these people , and japanese , he gives his formal apology to Kata , who surprises him by replying that he did his duty , and so did her husband , and that the apology was accepted . As his status as a 'stray dog ' is gently brushed aside , he gradually becomes accepted . When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto , he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive . In the end , as a desperate attempt at saving the village in which Katsumoto 's ancestors had worked so hard to build and protecet , Katsumoto and Algren lead an army of Samurai warriors against the rebuilt japanese army . Witnessing this scene was so sad . A doomed attempt . Since Samurai refuse to bear firearms , they were vastly at a disadvantage , against the cannons and the new automatic turrets . As a final test of honor , the remaining samurai charge the army , only to be vicously mowed down in the heat of battle . In a final touching moment , Algren and Katsumoto , wounded , Katsumoto perhaps fatally , contemplate Katsumoto 's suicide in honor , only to end in the deed being done and Algren witnessing the utmost peace in death in honor . He Presents Katsumoto 's sword to the emperor , who realizes that he had been wrong to let his 'advisors ' lead him around too much , and that it was wrong to forget his honor . A simply AWE inspiring film , a must see , for anyone .",m,1
"For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster , The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter . My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor , disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good . In fact , though , the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth , the acting and pacing is excellent , and while there is some sentimental nonsense , it restrains itself more than most films do these days . The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography , the way that deaths of important characters are treated , and some of the images which arouse real pathos . < p > It 's still nothing spectacular , though - it never really risks saying anything that has n't been said before , or presenting some image which has n't been seen before - but it 's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience .",m,1
"While it may not be historically accurate and exact does anyone know of any film created in Hollywood that is ? I mean come on folks , it 's Hollywood . And I love Hollywood because mostly it 's all entertaining . The Last Samurai is entertaining and somewhat historically accurate , but the best thing about this movie to me is the underlying message . The one about Honor . Duty . Bushido and the Samurai way . If you 've ever wondered about the Samurai or heard about them but did n't quite & quot ; get it & quot ; , watch this movie . Then you will & quot ; get it & quot ; . The mind , the culture , the beauty of the Japanese Samurai mind . I saw this movie the same week that I saw the 3rd Lord of the Rings , and my first comment upon leaving the theater was , & quot ; Wow that was 10 times better than the Lord of the Rings & quot ; . For me it was and it is . Enjoy .",m,1
"This film has been compared a lot to Dances with Wolves due to the fact that they both share similar themes . A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it . < p > However , Edward Zwick 's film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character , Lt . Nathan Algren Cruise is down on his luck , having become a drunken caricature of his former self , deeply regretful of his actions , who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai . < p > As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they 're not ready for it . As a result , the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai . During that battle , Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors , getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto , the last great Samurai leader , who orders him captured and brought to his son 's village as a prisoner . < p > Once there , Algren 's life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people . They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be . After spending winter with them , Algren `` changes sides '' and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor 's army . < p > The title of the movie tells the final outcome . The Samurai lose the battle . Progress triumphs over tradition . New over old . But Algren 's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai . < p > The true worth of this movie is its look . You can definetely see where the budget went other than Cruise 's salary . A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing . The costumes are simply amazing , especially the battle armors . The costume designer is Ngila Dickson , who also worked in Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings trilogy . < p > Also of notice are the battle scenes , which are breathtaking . Very violent , but not gratuitous , they serve the story very well . < p > As for the acting , Cruise does a fine job , and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award , but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe who was indeed nominated as Katsumoto . His presence demands attention . He is the center of every scene he 's in . Koyuki 's performance as Taka , Katsumoto 's sister and Algren 's love interest , should also be noticed .",m,1
"The poetic resonance of `` The Last Samurai '' makes it a unique and thoughtful epic where two warriors contrasted by culture are akin in honor . The modernization of Japan serves as the underlying for the collision of differences between Nathan Algren Tom Cruise and Katsumoto Ken Watanabe . Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever-changing world . < p > The second act of `` The Last Samurai '' is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle . All that is demolished by the third act . I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem . Instead , the last scene was not necessary , it was inconsistent with the tone of the movie , and it went against everything the development of the movie . By having the modernized Japanese army kneel for the samurais and having the Emperor suddenly dismiss the arms agreement with the U . S . and becoming tearful for the samurais , it has sugarcoated the entire film . The film was about the honor carried by the samurais and how it is slowly diminishing beneath Western influences . Then all of a sudden , as if to make the audience feel a little bit better , director Edward Zwick decides to make a happy ending where all the samurais died victorious . We already know that the samurais are the heroes who died for a cause , but to have the Emperor suddenly feel apologetic makes him and the movie appear as feeble . It lost its greatness after the second act . < p > -Please finish my review at www . filmwiseguy . funtigo . com",m,1
"THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie . The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle . Sadly , I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen : now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype . THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie , a story of men overcoming their personal demons , of the power of allegiance to ideals , of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor , of growth of the human spirit and soul . < p > 1876 , and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to & quot ; Westernize & quot ; the country , and the army in particular , to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai , a band of dedicated , gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness . The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden , alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley Tony Goldwyn . The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor 's spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto Ken Watanabe they are naturally beaten . Algren , through his native skills as a fighting man , is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka Koyuki of a man Algren had killed . Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren , his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren , Katsumoto , and Taka . The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors ' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values . < p > The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is ! But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise . They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn , Koyuki , Timothy Spall , etc . The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful , the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent , and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender . Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film . Give this one a try in your home and see that it is better than you 'd expected .",m,1
"Have seen this pic in cinema here irelandthought it was pretty damn good cruise pulled off this one very well -only thing to disapoint was on battle field riding back to the samuri troops , think too many films of this nature are doing that braveheart battle scence , but overall that this was a pretty good film had me on edge of seat at timestroughly recomend to watch or buy . . . .",m,1
"As a man who loves Kurawowa and other films of this genre , when I saw Tom Cruise was making this , I thought , `` You have got to be kidding . . . . . . . `` Then I saw parts of his Oprah stint and said , `` Plllleeeease . `` < p > Once again I underestimated Tom . Sorry about that TC . < p > The film was magnificent . I would have to say it is Oscar worthy , but those dumbasses who do the judging do not know anything about foreign films . Crouching Tiger deserved best pic darn it ! ! ! ! < p > I can not believe The Last Samurai was not nominated for best picture .",m,1
"A solid war film with epic battle scenes . A bloodbath , however , with a penchant for excessive violence , this film seeks a portrayal of glory and honor through battle in the name of the Emperor . On an ancillary note : Cruise exercises considerable poetic license , but this is overshadowed by the sheer framework of the story itself -- the way it should be for historical narrative . < p > The Framing of the film . < p > As pointed out in the film , the term 'samurai ' means 'to serve ' and the eeking out of this fidelity to imperial principles is the backdrop for conflict to be settled in a massive bloodletting -- what we have here is an eclipsing of the times . Foreign influences invading and suffocating cultural heritage , advanced weaponry and commercialism strangling the Japanese economic and political powers . What frames this contest of arms vs . honor , of modern vs . tradition , is a mutiny of cultural identity that has turned the government in on its own people . A nation whose own traditions are left to the wayside in favor of a 'costume ' of foreign security . This is a country eating itself up -- a self-devouring nation ravaging itself and thereby allowing outsiders to ravage it further . This crisis of national identity -- the effect of `` wannabes '' donning the latest novelty fad and `` purists '' upholding a cultural epistemology -- divides the nation and sets the stage for an unforgettable clash of political ideology . < p > For those who enjoyed the `` Meiji patriotism '' of the samurai exhibited in The Last Samurai , I recommend Yukio Mishima 's classic novel , Runaway Horses , which chronicles the rise of leftist `` purist '' resentment towards invading influences that were growing rampant cancerous in the nation 's economic and political sectors during the modern era .",m,1
"You already have the story line , so I wo n't repeat that . This film shows Cruise 's maturation as a SERIOUS actor - finally ! ! The other performances are also fantastic ; the actors are obviously all serious , veteran actors . They should have an Academy Award for `` Best Casting '' ; and this film should have won it . The film is often graphic e . g . , the final battle scene ; but at other times extremely delicate , subtle and sublime e . g . , Cruise 's scenes with the wife and children of the man whom he killed in battle . Often not a word is said - but the eyes , body movements , and lighting speak to us in soft tones . The Japanese actress KOYUKI who plays `` Taka '' , widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor . Koyuki makes Sophie Marceau and Charlize Theron pale by comparison . This movie is a MUST !",m,1
"It has battle scenes yes ; it has maybe a political point of view , but what really moves about this movie is the marvelous portrayal of values we often forget about . The human side of the soldier interesting now that these are war times . And also the family , friendship , loyalty , adult children relationships Cruise and the little Japanese boy , superb ! and above all , love a pure and sustained vision of love . It also serves us to look at a different and needed vision of Japanese stereotypes as seen on classic American war movies . Wacht out for Ken Watanabe 's camera friendly expression ; he won an Oscar for it !",f,1
"Wow ! ! In his opening scene , when Tom Cruise fires his Winchester above the heads of the assembled host , he 's shooting a `` Rifleman 's Special . `` I suspect that only those who grew up watching Chuck Connors will see it , but there it is . A beautiful thing to behold . Meanwhile speaking of beholding . . . . , this is a first class movie . One of the all too rare `` blockbusters '' that transcends the cliche . The movie quite sensitively depicts both the clash of East and West and their reconciliation whilst ultimately telling the story of the End of Things , the destruction of a Way of Life . It is a one of those very rare not-to-be-missed movies .",m,1
"This movie being categorized as action , pretty much misrepresents what it 's about . Yes , it has action in it amazing battle scenes , however it 's central theme has to deal with honor , the loss of it , and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society . On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living , and on the other you have the Samurai , more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive . Now , some people say the title of this movie refers to Tom Cruise 's character , others including me say it refers to Watanabe 's character , Katsumoto , who loosely represents the real life Saigo Takamori , the real life samurai who was considered the actual & quot ; last samurai & quot ; . Some reviewers also describe Tom 's character , Algren , as the white man who swoops in to save the day . I say he was simply a bystander caught up in the events of history . It 's not impossible to believe that a white man can get involve with the samurai , since this idea is borrowed from actual history of a westerner who adopts the samurai way of life during the rise of the Shogunate . No matter who 's name is credited first though , it would n't be much of a movie without the cast . With that said , Ken Watanabe , Hiro Sanada , and Koyuki make this movie . No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work . However , it is obvious that his character takes a back seat to what is supposedly the secondary plot of the samurai . Frankly , this is n't Cruise 's movie , it simply has Cruise in it .",f,1
"I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise , but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change . Granted , Cruise is a good actor , but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality . Nevertheless , I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise 's best films , if not his best film ever , because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt . Nathan Algren ; Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines . These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality . < p > Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film . Even though Cruise 's performance is excellent , the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast . Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord , Katsumoto . On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura , and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities . In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai . Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular . In addition , the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization . At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture . Last but not least , the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal . As always , Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film . < p > My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much . It would have been nice if the other characters , Ujio , Taka , and Katsumoto , received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance . Slight criticism aside , this is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I would recommend to virtually anyone who asked .",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' is everything a movie should be - exciting , emotional , and involving . Though I would not go so far to say that it 's a masterpiece , it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003 , and without having seen the new `` Lord of the Rings '' , it 's definitely near the top of the list . It will no doubt draw comparison with `` Braveheart '' because of the epic battles and the emotional climax , but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other `` battle epics '' . < p > Tom Cruise who spent two years learning Japanese plays Nathan Algren , a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze . His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country . His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle . He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways , and growing fond of the discipline , skill , and tact that the Samurai display . Knowing of the Emperor 's motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace , he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds . < p > There are many subplots and characters , some predictable Hollywood fodder do you smell a love story cooking ? , but most are effective and necessary to the overall story . `` The Last Samurai '' is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout . As you can expect , many of the battles are long , drawn out , and very bloody . But the violence is never gratuitous , and it knows it 's limits . As far as performances go , Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable , and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them . What really deserves special mention is the cinematography , which captures Japans lush valleys , majestic temples , and overall aesthetic beauty . The battle choreography is also stellar , obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' is not a history lesson , so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions . What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level , which is exactly what we go to movies for .",m,1
"I ca n't find the words to describe this truly amazing movie . I was not a huge fan of Tom Cruise , but since it looked like it would be pretty good from the preview , I decided I had to see it . This movie exceeded my expectations . Tom Cruise really surprised me and delivered such a wonderful performance in this movie . I feel that this movie was a gipped from being nominated for an Oscar . I thought for sure it would have been . If the Last Samuari had been nominated for an Oscar , and if , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King was n't in the running this year which truly deserved to win by the way , then I think that The Last Samuari should of been best picture of 2003 . I feel that some people have overlooked this movie , and I am not sure why . It is such a beautiful movie , full of emotion , and wonderful performances . This movie is a true masterpiece .",f,1
"This Movie by far is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life ! ! ! ! ! No kidding ! Its about damn time they came out with a movie like this ! I 'm surprised to see Tom Cruise in it for I had under estimated his acting abilities ! I give him as well as Ken Watanabe great props ! ! ! ! They are truly wonderful actors and now one of my most favorites . . . . . I cant tell you how great this movie was ! It moved me in sooooo many ways . . . Ways as in the movie having parts that were funny , a lot of actions parts , and the best of all the dramatic parts . . . I like seriously cried 3 times ! ! ! And I hav n't done sooo in a long time when watching a movie ! ! ! That just tells you how more powerful this movie is ! ! ! It takes you there with all the Japanese Samurais and gives you another perspective on that kind of people . . . . Leaving the movies had me at a higher respect and a new look at the Japanese culture ! for I give a lot of respect to them and what they 've done ! ! ! < p > This movie has been definitly life changing for me and I recommend it to Everyone ! ! ! ! !",m,1
"I had owned this dvd and watched it many times ! This is a cinematic spectacle with lush cinematography and action , as well as a fantastic storyline ! I wanted to watch it one day and could not find it ! I literally went right to amazon . com and ordered it and am happy I did . It definately makes my top 25 films of all time in a collection of over 7000 titles ! Go out and get this movie if you have not seen it . You 'll be glad you did ! Michael",m,1
This is one of the best action movies since interview with the vampire . Do n't know how anyone can rate it less than 5 stars . Great drama action . :,m,1
"I 'm not big on movies . This one is big . I do n't normally watch R movies . This one is R because of the realistic battle scenes . I was struck with character quality after character quality throughout the movie . By the end of it , my soul was ringing with words like , 'courage , valor , honor , dignity , purity , perfection ' . I have to say that I felt I was educated in Japanese history culture to a degree by this movie . I have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie . The battle scenes are 'glorious ' , and the shifts from normal speed to slo-mo are perfect . Sound also has some zoom effects that do n't distract , but add to the themes of this movie . It is a movie I will watch again sometime . Excellent movie . You should see it if you have n't yet . I think it will make you want to go to Japan it had that effect on me .",m,1
"This is a great movie to show in history classes . It 's a great tool of showing how Japan was `` westernized . `` The no need for Samurai , the American training of Japanese troops , cannons , guns , the awful machine gun . Even Western style clothing , electricity , and modernization of mostly everything . And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived . Not only is this a great teaching tool but it 's great entertainment . It 's not that bad of a movie . There 's a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself . This movie has actually sparked my interest in the Japanese history . I do believe this movie does open your eyes a little to of pre-modern Japan and the changes Emporer Meiji made . It 's a good buy .",f,1
"In a day of movies based solely on how much special effects they can pack in 2 hours , this is really a different movie . Yes , there are battles with blood spilled all over but this is accessory to the plot . The story is what appealed to me . The old Japan is lost and it is a shame . This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture . Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an amazing feat . Of course there is a touch of Hollywood but that 's ok . Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors . Ken Watanabe is simply brilliant .",m,1
"Many have seen this wonder of a movie . If you do n't have the DVD 2 disk version , then you are missing out on so much more . The first disc has the movie and right after that they have the full movie again but this time with the directors commentary on every aspect of the film as it plays . The second disk has special features including interviews with the actors and what I think is worth the price of the DVD by itself : The code of the Samurai . The meaning and essential core of Bushido - what has guided generations of Japanese - is exemplified in these writings . We , in America , living in an age of twisted values and dishonor - the Code of the Samurai is a necessary template for our youth . Ken Watanabe , along with the many Japanese actors , are supurb . The woman who plays Taka displays the epitomy of feminine beauty and grace . Warning to all men : She will steal your heart . Another especially notable scene is when Tom Cruise holds the 8 year old boy as he grieves for what he believes to be the last time he shall see the paternal figure that Tom Cruise had come to be for him - tears shall flow . It is very touchingly done - you can not help but feel the pain - for parents - your paternal and maternal instincts will emerge and highten . This movie - more than any I have seen - incorporates the Japanese spirit and what we in America must instill in our children if they are to have a chance against the selfish and hedonistic `` values '' and examples that inundate our media . Love , Courage , Loyalty and above all - Honor . . . . this movie is a shinning example . The quality of the essentials of movie making are already legendary in this movie . Buy it for the values that this movie so beautifully demonstrates .",m,1
"It 's really 90 100No , it 's no way near perfect b c Hollywood made this film . Why you 'd wannna buy it:1 . One of the best battle scenes ever at the Lord of the Rings Braveheart Glory level 2 . It 's an epic ; it 's something new-no gladiators american wars3 . Sad as HELL ! I 'm not gon na blow anything away yet4 . Superb performance by Wantanabe , Cruise-what can I say ? The guy can ACT ! Why some ppl . did n't like it:1 . VERY VERY inaccurate . Please do n't study for the World History China Japan test using details from this film . The Saurai are misrepresented as pure good guys and the Japanese govt . as pawns for the US . Not true ! 2 . Time inconsistency- samurai techniques that took years to master can now be done by Cruise in less than a year3 . First 15 minutes of the movie , a guy kicks Samurai [ . . . ] . Later , he ca n't even touch them in a practice fight ! Adrenaline ? Go figure . . . Overall-despite its flaws , it ranks # 9 in my Personal Favorites b c I 'm an epic lover the Lord of the Rings , Lawrence of Arabia , Braveheart , Gladiator , Glory , Spartacus , Patriot , etc . It has great costumes , excellent cinematography , solid acting with honorable mention to Wanatanbe , and is just a great movie .",m,1
"Good costumes , terrific and brutal battle scenes in a breath-taking sequence which often resembles `` Braveheart '' and a few hints of the samurai tradition , but the final result is rather mediocre , because the story itself has a weak historical foundation and little relation to reality . I can hardly imagne rebel samurais slaying so remorselessly their brethren who serve in the national Japanese Army , and 19th century was certainly not like the 16th century `` the golden age of Japan '' when the rival warlords were fighting each other in an endless series of savage but highly ritual battles . Edward Zwick 's work is a good `` modern '' action movie but certainly not a classic . The obvious lack of authenticity leaves the film with only 3 stars . It is no match for Kurosawa 's epic films .",m,0
"Do you imagine the awful scenes of what it meant the invassion of the German Panzers in Polland Sepember 1 1939 when the resistance fought ridden on horses ? Well , this was the impression i reminded on the last sequence of this film . The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture . The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns . He is an antihero a man committed with nothing except himself . He is a haughty man . A mercenary without scruples who accidentally will discover a new world and will receive a slap in the facewhen he discovers the ancient traditions of this warriors . The ideological conflict between the ancestral ways of life and the modernity tradition will become in the central nervous of the film . Ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film . Filmed as a Sumphony in four moments , retains its interest all along the film except the conclusion , its only fault . Do you really expect that the hero presence after the battle is necesary ? Do you imagine a hero being interviewed , and telling his old memories for instance ? Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ? This resolution final twists a wondeful film loaded with epic spirit . But if you miss this little detail you will be rewarded by far with this picture . Superb art direction and special effects .",m,1
"If you are in to movies like Spartacus , Braveheart and Gladiator , then this should be on your list of movies to check out . The Last Samurai is about a captain , played by Tom Cruise , from the US army in the late 1800s that is sent to Japan to train soldiers in the way of modern warfare . Tom Cruise 's character ends up getting captured by the enemy , who are a civilization of samurai warriors who have chosen to uphold the ancient traditions of Japan . Throughout the movie , there is a conflict of interest between the new and old traditions and it is interesting to see the ways of the samurai throughout the film . There are both small fights and epic battles , both of which are done very well and are very entertaining to watch . Through all of the culture , battles and story line is some amazing cinematography . On top of that , the acting was superb . The Last Samurai is very entertaining and interesting movie that is solid from start to finish and fits in nicely with any collection of epic style movies .",m,1
"I enjoyed the movie . The sets and scenary were beautiful . The acting was excellent . Tom Cruise created a complex character . The battle scenes were reminscent of Braveheart . The comparison to & quot ; Dancing with Wolves & quot ; is fairly accurate . Both movies argue the thesis that other cultures are inherently superior morally and spiritually to the spiritually bankrupt Western European United States culture . There was a lot of spurting blood . The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good . < p > The clash of cultures was interesting . I do not know enough about the history of this period to judge its historical accuracy . I know the broad strokes were true . The Japanese Emperor hired Civil War veterans to modernize his armies and the Emperor had to put down the Ronans because they refused to modernize . There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period . < p > My main gripe about the movie was the ending . The movie went on too long . I enjoyed the movie , but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth .",m,0
"I really enjoyed it . I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured , i still thought it was a very good film . I also bought the soundtrack-it was excellent .",f,1
"I can not say enough about this movie . A lot of people were turned off before they even saw it because Tom Cruise plays a samurai . I say their loss . This was a fantastic story about a man whose past haunts him . He plays an American soldier who is captured by the enemy whose culture he is supposed to be helping destroy and the experience changes his life forever . The story was fantastic , the scenery was gorgeous , the costumes were exquisite , the acting was phenomenal . This movie is definitely on my 10 best of 2004 .",f,1
"There 's a cast of thousands and millions of dollars invested in this epic and it will probably pay off for Hollywood . The theme is an inspiring one too . It 's set in the late 19th Century , where Tom Cruise , a veteran of the Civil War as well as some cruel Indian massacres , goes to Japan to train the Emperor 's army against the Samurai so that Japan can modernize . That 's an oversimplification of this politically correct story for which I have seen no claims of being historically accurate . < p > < p > Soon , Cruise is captured by the Samurai and , learns to respect them . Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans . There 's excellent cinematography of a Japan that no longer exists and well-orchestrated battle scenes that are spectacular and bloody . And , not surprising , I felt no emotion other than to marvel at the great costuming and special effects . < p > < p > This is the third film about Japan I 've seen in the last few weeks . Clearly , it is the weakest . It 's not that it 's not well done . It is . But it 's basically a genre film that cost big bucks . < p > < p > It 's fine escape fiction though . The sets are great . And you 'll be entertained . Mildly recommended .",f,1
"The dream : Katsumoto , a rebellion leader whose only interest was to obtain a free Japan . he beleived that Japan should be governed by Japanese cultures and ideologies than Western . In my opinion , this movie opened my eyes showing me that culture is very important in our society because it protects and prevails our natural rights . `` I 'm not critizing others who emphasize more on the characters than the moral and cultural message of the movie '' . In the same way , this movie was presented as a historical `` tale '' , where protectors samuraies waere considered protectors and regulators of the Japanese Empire . I gave this movie 5 thumbs up becuase it reflects what Japan was , is and will be . By the way , the most interesting about this movie is that it does not contain sexual scenes most likely others . :",m,1
"Throw in a wolf and some blue face paint and that 's pretty much what you 've got : Dances with Wolves meets Braveheart . Civil war soldier thrown into the culture of his enemy mixed with a social class fighting for their right to exist . < p > Aside from the derivative nature of the movie and the music ; it was at times note for note The Thin Red Line , but they were both done by Hans Zimmer so at least in his case he was ripping himself , it was actually a pretty good film . Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far , partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop . < p > The message of the film is a very positive one , that of honor and courage , even in the face of unbeatable odds , a code almost completely foreign to the average American . Even with this , it 's a still a somewhat depressing film , watching the demise of an ancient and majestic society , which was traded in for the pop culture of the West . < p > At times the action was a little overwhelming for this type of film . At one point there was an attack from ninjas that almost degenerated into Kill Bill Vol . 1 - a little too much ninja for the epic journey film maybe . The last criticism is a technical one - while the cinematography was wonderful , the sets were not . There are times , mostly at the beginning when we see shots of San Francisco , and then a distance shot of Mt . Fuji , that it looks less real than a Bob Ross painting . I really would n't have expected this from such a high budget film .",m,1
"I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it -- action , drama , history , it had it all . Tom Cruise was excellent , oscar worthy in my opinion , but the costars also gave powerful performances . I am buying this movie on DVD when it is released !",m,1
"In THE LAST SAMURAI , Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren , a self loathing , alcoholic , Civil War vet just fired from giving demonstrations of Winchester rifles . A former comrade Billy Connolly gets him a job training the new Japanese Army to fight against the samurai , who are rebelling against moderization . Algren is captured by the samurai and becomes an ally of Katsumoto Ken Wantanabe , the samurai leader . I 'm not a huge Cruise fan , but I do think this is one of his better performances . He seems to have a knack for displaying self-disgust MAGNOLIA and he taps into it here . The film 's first act is its strongest part . Cruise is believably decrepit , and the opening battle , where the samurai swoop down on the frightened Japanese soldiers , is haunting . Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together . In the film 's middle section , Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai . This seems to consist of walking around , meditating , and practicing swordfighting . Cruise and Wantanabe have several metaphysical conversations , and Wantanabe performs with wonderful wit and economy , but nothing happens for far too long . THE LAST SAMURAI is entertaining , if a bit bloated , and contains several superior action sequences .",m,0
"1876 in Japan , an American soldier named Nathan Algren Tom Cruise has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai . He does get captured by the Samurai leader Katsumoto Ken Watanabe while in battle as he is brought to their village , Nathan begins to learn the ways of their life and even becomes one of the people for 2 years as learns to switch sides to fight on their side for honor and love . An amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic `` Glory '' Edward Zwick is one of the decade 's best pictures . Co-starring Tony Goldwyn , Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story . Although very similar to films like `` Man Named Horse '' , `` Dances with Wolves '' , `` Lawrence of Arabia '' or `` Last of the Mohicans '' this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia . The acting is flawless as is the direction , the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer 's score . This Blu-Ray offers quality picture in a great transfer that looks fresher and the sound is good as well and the extras include audio commentary , History Channel Documentary : Hollywood vs . History , 4 featurettes , deleted scenes , Japan premiere and trailer .",m,1
"Call it `` Dances with Asians '' or `` Japaneseheart , `` Edward Zwick 's `` The Last Samurai '' suffers from a near-fatal case of seen-it-before-itis . If the `` I have n't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet '' presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine , you 'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare . His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better , though even Ken Watanabe , who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity , is no Toshiro Mifune . Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan 's shallow script , which like most Western films about the East , implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped ; but for all of the posturing , there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash . Instead , viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films with corrected titles , as well as `` Gladiator '' and `` The Last of the Mohicans , `` not beaten this one to the punch . Zwick even plagiarizes his own film , the much better `` Glory , `` and fans of Hans Zimmer 's `` The Thin Red Line '' soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film . All in all , `` The Last Samurai '' is n't a bad film . With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity , such as ill-fitting uniforms , it 's also not bad to look at , even if some suspiciously modern looking powerlines turn up in one scene . It 's just that we 've seen most of it already .",m,0
"How come , when all the people get cut down in a full charge INTO a huge array of guns , Tom Cruise lives ? That 's crap . Anything to have a Hollywood , idiot ending , I guess . It 's a suicide charge , yet our guy goes back to his little darlin ' afterwards . What a load of crap ! Thanks .",m,0
"After scanning some of the negative reviews posted here I must say I am shocked to learn that ANYONE could find this movie anything but exceptional . The words `` boring '' and `` tedious '' have no place desrcibing this exceptional film . It 's beautifully shot , wonderfully acted , full of humor , poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets , etc , I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie . My wife , who reluctantly attended the sneak preview , fell so in love with this film that she insists on seeing it again on Friday when it makes its full release . There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves , etc , but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner . You wo n't be disappointed .",m,1
"After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition , and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867 , things went very fast . Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA . But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais , and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent . This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais . This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA , an exclusive contract , and military counsellors . The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them . The film shows this very well . The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan . The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor , no real democracy , no concertation . Just change , and profits for a few . The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force . Japan needed new markets and new workers . They found them in Formosa , in China , in Manchuria , in Korea , and they even tried to conquer Siberia . We know what that process led to forty years later . We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles , and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation , and sooner or later the two come together . Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic . < p > Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",m,1
"& quot ; The Last Samurai & quot ; is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation . The battle scenes are created with great action and detail , as are the solo sword fights . And while the action is breathtaking , they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor , sacrifice and change . Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career , and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Katsumoto He was robbed at the Oscars . While I have n't yet had time to view the special features , none are really needed , for this film could stand on its own ! Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection ! Movie DVD Grade : A+",m,1
"I love this movie . There are few movies I can watch over and over . This would be one . I am a fan of Tom Cruise but not a fanatic fan . He is a very nice looking man and can act fairly well . But I do n't see any Oscars in his future . That being said , I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more . I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture , however , even if he were n't in the picture , it could have stood on its own . Ken Watanabe is a superb actor , not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto . Other actors of note include : Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio and might I add another hunk of burning love ; Shin Koyamada , who played Nobutada , Katsumto 's son and Tom Cruise 's first Japanese friend and Maisha Khan , who played Taka , Katsumto 's widowed sister and mother of two young boys and Tom Cruise 's love interest . As a little twist to the story , Tom had killed her husband in battle early in the movie , thus complicating her initial feelings for him . The movie is epic albeit predictable throughout and the ending is a semi-tearjerker . But that 's okay . You wo n't feel slighted and you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again despite knowing the ending . It is semi-family safe , no nudity that I can recall , maybe some mild curse words , but nothing that is over the top . I watched it with my family . But one word of caution : it is very , very violent . Decapitations , amputations , other bodily mutilations during the battle scenes ; these are samurai with very , very sharp swords and they used them very effectively . So remove all small children and those with queasy stomachs from the room before viewing .",f,1
"Set in Japan during the 1870s , Tom Cruise plays Capt . Nathan Algren , an American military leader hired to train Japan 's army in modern warfare . He is a drunk mercenary tortured by his inner demons . In his first encounter against the Samurai , Algren is captured by Katsumoto , played brilliantly by Ken Watanabe . He quickly is impressed by the Samurai 's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity . Ultimately , he finds himself at Katsumoto 's side , driven by his sense of honor . This is a great film and probably Tom Cruise 's best . It is beautifully written and acted . It is also loaded with brilliant cinematography and amazing battle choreography . An epic and worth mentioning with such great films like Gladiator and Braveheart ! A must own for any collector . NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS : A very nice transfer that enhances all the beauty of Japan 's landscape . The audio is slightly lacking but better than the previous dvd release . All the special features are carried over . FINAL VERDICT : IT WOULD BE DISHONORABLE NOT TO UPGRADE ! A MUST OWN !",m,1
"Is this what we were all waiting for ? ? YES ! ! ! Incredible image . Crisp . Rich . Full of detail . Incredible contrast . Amazing colors . This is exactly what HDTV is all about . HD-DVD really got me . I was once a Blu-ray supporter , but now I 've got to admit . HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do : DELIVER ! This HD-DVD have all the extras we find on the regular DVD . How great can it get ? Shame on Blu-ray ! Just give me more HD-DVD movies ! I ca n't get enough of it .",m,1
I love this movie ! ! ! I saw it in theaters and loved every second of it . It is the reason that I love Japan and Samurai . What I like most about it is n't just the cinematics but the moral behind it . Honor . . .,m,1
"To start off , this was a splendidly filmed movie with a fine sound track . After that , I do n't have much to say favorably . I 'm not an expert on early modern Japanese history , but as a journeyman I know enough to say with confidence that the story here is preposterous . The Japanese looked to Germany Prussia , not the US for army training . Emporer Meiji , the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler and was n't referred to as Meiji until after his death , just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa . The dramatizations and interplay of the characters , however , is what was really preposterous . It may make for decent drama , but this is the sort of film that leads to typical American ignorance about foreign countries and their histories . Anyone sincerely curious about this era in Japan might well read James Clavell 's imperfect , but vastly better , Gai Jin or , better yet , Lafcadio Hearn 's memoirs which point out that it was virtually impossible for a westerner to assimilate in late Nineteenth Century Japan . The producers of this film ought to be profoundly ashamed of themselves over this script which is nearly as bad as the despicably similar Bushido Blade of about 20 years ago . This does n't mean that one should n't see this , only that it ought not to be taken seriously .",m,0
"I really enjoyed this movie . Thank goodness , there was n't any unnecessary sex scenes which seem to be in most movies these days . This movie has action adventure and yet has at least one scene which has brought a tear to everyone I know that 's seen this movie . In a nutshell , this movie shows what respect is all about !",f,1
"& quot ; The Last Samurai & quot ; is the same story as & quot ; Dances with Wolves & quot ; - bitter Civil War vet goes off to a far away land and encounters a group of people looked down upon by Western Civ as & quot ; savages & quot ; but are instead a poetic and noble culture . The idea is nice , but overly simplifies feudal Japan , which was n't exactly a peaceful and idyllic place all of the time . The acting is good , the story is OK , but the ending is downright silly and unnecessary . I wo n't spoil it for those that have n't yet seen the movie , but let 's just say that the & quot ; true & quot ; ending would 've involved Tom Cruise meeting a noble death on the battlefield . Instead , he lives happily ever after , which was not the message of the rest of the movie .",m,0
"What we should appreciate before we get too deep into the odd story of Captain Algren is that he it is strikingly similar to John Blackthorne , the English pilot of a Dutch ship that ends up in Japan in Clavell 's near genius-like rendition of & quot ; Shogun . & quot ; < p > Without discrediting Tom Cruise who acted brillinatly I thought , the story does live up to general aspects of the & quot ; Shogun & quot ; tale but falls short in a few other areas . The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed , passionate , forbidden and conspiratorial . < p > Likewise , the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact , believable however it seems to happen swiftly . Too swiftly to remain completely credible . The script and Cruise 's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity , which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne . Well . Really seduces Blackthorne . But then again , it is Nathan that who becomes a true warrior , and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes . < p > All in all a nice ride , sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things ' genre and allow you to think . < p > Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting . Taka is wonderful ; the children are animated and innocent . The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again , seemed to add credibility . I should also mention that there are similar 'blood lines ' in the Indian Rights oriented & quot ; A Man Called Horse , & quot ; less interesting , less fulfilling , but possibly equally provacative . < p > Good job to all . 5 stars . Larry Scantlebury",m,1
"Comparing Samurai to Nazi 's is just plain stupid ! Should we compare the US army in the 1870 's to Nazi 's ? < p > Is this movie history ? I think so . Not because of the events as depicted in the movie , but for an attempt to capture a people 's values at some point of time . It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa 's epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes . We forget that the stories of King Arthur are very large fabrications of the West 's transition point to from the time of the ancients to middle ages , that the knights virtues in writing were pure but in reality they were brutal instead of kind . < p > That is the point of movies , to inspire and build up our view of humanity while being careful not to extoll to heavilly the villains . Tom Cruise 's redemption after massacring Indians is one point of the film . How he finds peace and honor is another . How a society of traditional values finds itself eclipsed by the modern values of greed are clearly evident themes in both modern Japan and the US whether it is true or not is not the point . Can something in the Samurai spirit of the film be used to inspire us ? Or must we only see this in films about hobbits and dwarfs partially inspired by the horrors that Tolkein saw in WWI ? < p > Technically the sword tactics were very well done and remain one of the few films that captures kenjutsu correctly . Cruise worked his tail off to make it credible and despite the time it would really would take to do so , it was still done well . < p > The filming in Japan was fantastic . The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well . The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured . The leader of the Samurai was also well liked by the common people then named a street after him shortly after he died may not be the exact historical replica of the man but most of the Samurai following were `` pissed '' at loosing their swords and topknots which represented critical parts of their heritage , not about attacking Korea . < p > So the question is . . . do we want a documentary or a movie to inspire us ?",m,1
"Remember that boring long mini series back in 1982 called Shogun ? ! Well . . . this movie is like that but better and shorter version ; less than three hours ! It 's only 154 minutes long to be exact ! Anyway , Tom Cruise delivers his finest performance as an ex-civil war hero who is hired to go to Japan and train the modern army against the samurais . However , during the first losing battle , he was captured and held as a prisoner at the camp filled with trained samurais . Then he falls in love with a wife of the slained warrior he killed during the first war in Japan . While he is living in the village as a `` slave '' ; he learns the culture of the samurai people . Then he learns how to fight like them as well . After he is released and returned back to the then modern day Tokyo , he is n't welcomed among friends because he wears the samurai clothes instead of civilian clothes of the 1860 's . Then Samurai General is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon . Tom rescues him from prison and escapes back to the village . They prepares for the war the following week . The final battle scene is amazing how sword bound samurais fighting rifle shooting Japanese army . And I will not tell you about the ending because you must buy this DVD ! It 's superb !",m,1
"This was a great movie not because of Tom Cruise . . . but because Ken Watanabe steals the movie . He is fantastic in this film and is an exceptional actor . He makes the movie worth watching . The scene at the end is beautifully played by Watanabe and a tearjerker . If it was n't for Cruise and his one dimensional acting , this movie could have been superb .",f,1
"Many of the reviewers liken this movie to `` Dances With Wolves '' but though there are some similiarites , the main difference is in the main character played by Tom Cruise . I 'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture -- in particular , bushido . Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I 'm not mistaken . Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick 's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography . If you can get this in Hi-Def HD-DVD or Blu-ray , I would recommend it particularly since the HD DVD price is below $ 10 ! !",m,1
"Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies , the cheap ending , the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass , and the negative liberal view of the white man 's legacy . All of these are valid points , but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades . One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history ; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores . For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai , Dances with Wolves , et al , I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance . Furthermore , this movie never claims to be based on facts , so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong . These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries . Somewhere in the middle lies reality . The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world , in a nation , and in a man . Troubled by his own violent past , Captain Algren Tom Cruise in his limited , grinning , wide-eyed fashion is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876 . The need for Cruise 's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself , but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience . The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography , the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own , powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast , an emotional score , and yes , the message , heavy-handed though it is . Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows , be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire , Jesse James or Wyatt Earp , Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it ca n't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license . Were it not morally reprehensible , they 'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis . . . . if they have n't already . There are n't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain . The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep .",m,1

"This movie is probably one of the best movies Tom Cruise has starred in as far as a storyline goes . While it may not be an action movie along the lines of the Mission Impossible series , it is a love story told against the backdrop of feudal Japan . The scenery is gorgeous and it actually has a plot to the story .",m,1

"Perfect . Hans Zimmer is a true genius and he has composed here the best score of his career so far . The music transcend the movie and the landscapes are just to-die-for . I own both DVD and Bluray of this film to be able to play it whenever and wherever I want . True , it 's not so historical but never claimed to be . Sit back , relax and enjoy the ride offered by a perfect cast . Nothing to waste here , and that 's quite rare so I better mention it !",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' is an excellent film , respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story . The `` foreigner joins a warrior culture , taking on their strange dress and winning their respect '' story is well-represented on film and in history , from Bonnie Prince Charlie to `` Lawrence of Arabia '' and `` Dances with Wolves , `` as well as the Japanese-themed `` Shogun , `` which is based on the life of Miura Anjin William Adams . Here , Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land , and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture . < p > Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history , I was pleased by all aspects of `` The Last Samurai . `` Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented , although the Samurai come out looking much better . The warrior code of Bushido is not explained , and the lifestyle is completely romanticized , yet this is a movie and not a history text . Emperor Meji is well-played , which surprised me . He is neither hero nor villain . And there are ninjas , which improves every film . < p > In the vein of the big Hollywood epics , `` The Last Samurai '' serves up healthy doses of sweeping score , beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy . The country has rarely looked so beautiful , although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines . The samurai armor , while not historically accurate , looks beautiful on film . There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick . A great looking cast helps as well . < p > To this day , Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization , as can be seen in books such as `` Dogs and Demons . `` `` The Last Samurai '' has some good lessons for modern Japan , and some good entertainment for us all .",m,1
I do n't like Tom Cruise but this movie is great . The story is great,m,1
"I 'm not a big Tom Cruise fan , but I ca n't think of anyone else who could have done as well in this movie . The additional segments about the making of the movie , Japanese culture , and the Samurai were also very good .",m,1
"sometimes makes a good movie . The Last Samurai is . Historical ? Hardly . Take a few grains : yes , Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient , militaristic culture , a law unto themselves , & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie 1876 . Aside from that . . . Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars . He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force . Who is the enemy ? The Samurai , who are much admired & feared through-out Japan . They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life . In battle he is captured by the Samurai . Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe . He is impressed by Cruise 's fighting skills & spares him . Can you guess the rest ? Of course . It 's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate . While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle . Oh the pain , the inner conflict , the over-acting . I said it was a GOOD movie C+ . That 's it . The Samurai are doomed , destroyed by time more than anything else . Well done battle scenes . Lots of really good extras in this two disc set . Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave . He put a lot of time & effort into this movie . Lots of background & interviews with other principals . They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood ? about the movie & the `` history '' behind it . In some ways the extras are better than the movie .",m,0
"The year is 1876 , Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise has been hired by the Japanese in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern ' and less 'traditional ' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai . Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto Ken Watanabe who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai . This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack . Tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance . He discovered after his capture that the samurai are peaceful and as bad as they are made out to be , Cruise 's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust . Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka , however this is n't a main part of the film it shows that the film is n't all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film . The Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a triumphant in the movie industry . Thanks for it 's gripping storytelling , and excellent character design . By far Tom 's Cruise 's finest hour .",m,1
"Though I 'm not a huge fan of Cruise 's , his acting 's been getting better with age . The Last Samurai is a solid film that shows us cultural clashes between American ideals and Japanese philosophies in a truly enjoyable way . Definitely worth watching !",m,1
This is a movie that is based in ancient japan and shows you the real way of the samurai . It was a time when old japan was being destroyed and the new japan was being born . It gives you a better understanding about that time period in japan . It really was a big part of history for japan . It just a great film .,m,1
"This was a very important part of history that everyone should want to know , also important to see how the western civilization affected nations across the globe .",m,1
The video audio transfer has excellent quality like what I experienced from other WB blu-ray discs in addition to being an enjoyable movie .,m,1
"Wow . This movie deserves so many awards I ca n't even think of enough . This movie was the first movie to make me cry watching it . This movie had to be the most inspirational movie I have ever seen . If you have n't seen it yet , you have to see it . Gladiator almost got me into tears at the end , but this movie finally did it . If you liked Gladiator , you will love this movie , especially if you are interested in Oriental culture .",m,1
"I was kinda disappointed at `` The Last Samurai '' . I was attracted to the idea of an American soldier , as played by Tom Cruise , and a group of samurai . However , what I discovered was a carbon copy of other works by director Edward Zwick , plus a little `` Dances With Wolves '' on the side . Let 's see : Tom Cruise plays an outcast soldier who finds himself looking for redemption in the company of some samurai , who kidnap him while training some Japanese soldiers to fight against those samurai . This is like Matthew Broderick , who plays a soldier and finds redemption by training and commanding a group of African-Americans in `` Glory '' -Zwick 's best movie . Also , it 's similar to `` Legends Of The Fall '' , where Brad Pitt plays a desertor from the Army during WWI and finds redemption with a group of indians . So , in those Edward Zwick movies , we find outcast soldiers in Broderick , Pitt , and Cruise . Ah , and let 's not forget Kevin Costner , who also plays an outcast soldier who finds comfort with the Sioux in `` Dances With Wolves '' ; only Zwick did n't direct that movie , Costner did . However , not all in `` The Last Samurai '' is negative . I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR 's Ngila Dickson 's costumes ; the cinematography by , I think , by Caleb Deschanel is truly enchanting ; Ken Watanabe 's outstanding performance as samurai leader Katsumoto is electrifying and charming at the same time ; and , more importantly , Hans Zimmer 's eclectic and marvelous music score , which I consider a great guilty pleasure of mine . In the end , I do n't think `` The Last Samurai '' is a classic . I just wished Edward Zwick had taken a different approach on a film that promised too much .",m,0
"When it first came out , i had no interest as i felt after learning of the story , that while tom cruise is a good action film actor , he didnt possess the depth of skill to pull off a film of this nature . After catching pieces of it on cable , i decided to make an effort and watch it from beginning to end , and did so a second time . I then bought it and watched it again . I became immersed in it more deeply each time , realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing . From the strength of the superb supporting characters , to the gradual changing of cruise 's character , and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers , this was an excellent film of substance , not traditionally done by hollywood . While i have seen Dances with wolves , as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline , i feel that not to be completely accurate . I also feel cruise 's portrayal was more convincing than Costner 's , and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness . There are , like all films , weaknesses , such as the lack of exploration of the samurai 's rejection of modernity , a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this , and the dialogue can be a bit lacking , such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled , these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai . Watch it with an open mind , and scrutinize the background secondary characters , all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent . And imho , it was a better picture than Return of the king , but than again , hollywood picked Titanic over LA Confidential for best picture , so who said hollywood is a place for the intelligent ?",m,1
"This movie has it all . Drama , action , amazing battle scenes - the best I 've ever seen . It 's definitely a must see .",m,1
Lots of action . . . . lots of action . . . . and still lots of action ! ! Good movie with a great storyline ! ! ! Tom Cruise did a wonderful job in this movie . . . . just be warned . . . there are many scenes of blood and guts . . . :,m,1
"I enjoyed the film , and will watch it again . It certainly does have its limitations though . . . Insufficient character development , under-developed plot , and a fair amount of things that in perspective to the history and culture being treated are just plain silly . This film could have been so much more , but alas it seems the film makers just did n't have it in them to go beyond the ordinary and produce something truly special . The soundtrack was the usual sorry mediocrity put out by Zimmer . . to cut him some slack , it seems he works too much - how many films does he score in a year ? Ultimate conclusion : Somewhat enjoyable , but nothing more . And frankly with a few offensive elements which ironically were put in to make it more politically correct . . . P . S . Seems to me that certain someones may have been watching some Rurouni Kenshin before making this film . . . hmmm . . . .",m,0
"I always was interested in the idea and ideals of the Samurai , but no one movie can envelope as much as this one . Others , like Ghost Dog : The Way of the Samurai , tend to only cover the ideals but twist the images we all have with the word & quot ; Samurai & quot ; by urbanizing it or whatever . This movie is great all around , of course there are things that someone will complain about , but I am completely satisfied with this film . Every actor actress Cruise , Watanabe , etc . pull off each roll so believably , that you tend to either want or plain out give all your attention to this path that the Samurai take . The fighting is great because it shows the actually processes that original Samurai used to both follow , show , and perform in their everyday lives . Some of the images are straight out of a dream or a book about the Samurai . The areas are just gorgeous . The foreign actors , also bring a whole new respect to all others through this film . Overall this film is very emotional for some , but most of all , a tribute to the image and values of the Samurai . Hope you like it just as much as I did .",m,1
"`` The Last Samurai '' was a story about a man who changes the way that he feels about a certain type of people in Japan . It stars Tom Cruise , but to me he was not the star of the film . I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe . The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory . The entire movie could win many different awards , and I 'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated , because I have seen him in much better roles , like `` Minority Report , `` or `` Vanilla Sky . `` His great scene comes towards the end , where he gives emotion and power at once . < p > Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren , a Civil War hero who loves to drink . He 's recently come from battling American Indians in the west , and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles . But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army , with somebody that he knows Bagley . Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians . Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant . When they make it to Japan , they are met by the translator Simon Graham , and they begin to train the troops for battle . But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away , and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto . Algren is almost killed during the battle , but taken back to Katsumoto 's village , which is ruled by his son . Algren is trapped , and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan . While with Katsumoto , he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill . But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight . Algren befriends Katsumoto , and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought , and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do . < p > '' The Last Samurai '' was a beautiful film . It had a beautiful sceney , beautiful action , some beautiful acting , and beautiful direction . I really did love it , and I am including it on the best of 2004 , only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year . This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre , otherwise it is not going to be an good . It is a big screen movie , and I have a feeling that I would have been disappointed if I saw it on video first . Try and see it now , before it totally disappears . < p > ENJOY ! < p > Rated R for strong violence and battle sequences .",m,1
"On seeing Edward Zwick 's `` The Last Sumurai '' , I had to deal with mixed feelings , good news and bad news . The good news : this is a big , beautiful movie relating an unusual story . In 1876 California an ex-Union officer Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise , who has battle scars both physical and psychic , is hired by Japanese diplomats to train an American-style army for the Emperor , conscripted against a renegade samurai Katsumoto Ken Watanabe . Katsumoto hates the Western ways increasingly threatening Japan . Katsumoto 's tragic story is not really that distant : it was only three decades ago that Yukio Mishima , frustrated in his attempt to protect Japan from the sterile corruption of Westernization , committed seppuku . Algren 's campaign to train the Emperor 's forces is not too successful when he orders them to hold fire , they do n't , and his first encounter with the rebel forces finds him a wounded prisoner . Algren is taken to Katsumoto 's mountain outpost and kept alive so that `` we may learn our enemy '' . One aspect of Japanese culture Algren is immediately obssessed with is sake ; but as his stay lengthens he becomes more attentive , learning the language , mastering kendo , and enjoying a Kyogen performance . In return , he attempts to teach baseball to the village boys ; but they seem to miss the concept , trying to catch the base runner instead of the ball . They 've come a long way . Cruise is an attractive actor , and this may be his best performance to date . Algren is introduced as a bitter , indeed a broken man ; but as his outlook becomes more philosophical there is a sincere depiction of a character desiring to understand the strange world around him . Cruise 's scenes with Watanabe , another charismatic actor , are the film 's most defining . Eventually , Algren takes sides with the samurai rebel , and when their Japanese forces face the Emperor 's Japanese forces on the battlefield , it must seem like d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu to the Civil War veteran , but this point is not belabored . The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll , as is the whole production . The world of mid-19th Century Japan is richly reproduced , and there 's even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco . The bad news : there is a major problem with `` The Last Samurai '' and it 's the ending . Why in the name of Chikamatsu did Zwick and his co-scenarists Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan , after creating such a sensitive and arresting story , mar it with such a weak conclusion ? All we need is a Henry Mancini coda . But , the ending notwithstanding , `` The Last Samurai '' , spectacular and intelligent , was one of the best movies of 2003 .",m,1
"What a rush ! This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time . I will not bother giving a synopses for the movie , but I will tell you what I loved . The movie has a great theme , that of a man seeking to atone for his sins . In the end , he finds the means to forgive himself through the help of another man , Kasamoto and his culture . Granted , there are several historial inaccurate items , but that does not stop this from being a great and enjoyable movie . < p > Tom Cruise name might get first billing for this movie , but Ken Watanabe steals the show as the honourable Kasamoto . He has rightly been honoured with a Academy Awards nomination . If anything , watch the movie for him !",m,1
"Would n't it be funny if a Japanese film crew made a film about a Japanese person who visited America during the Civil War , saw how honorable the black freedom fighters were and how violent and greedy the white people were , and in the end -- falls in love with the country , symbolized by his sexual conquest of American women , symbolized by a single female character in the whole film , who has to wear a corset and cook turkeys ? Let us call it something celebratory and romantic , like , The Last Confederate . I 'm sure Americans would flock to see this `` authentic '' film ! QUESTION : why is it that white people are so much more into samurai , death , and pride than people who live in japan today ?",m,0
"I was very resistant to see this movie . As a man of minority I was not all that excited about seeing another movie that promotes `` whiteman 's burden '' . Why does Hollywood not trust people with color with our own stories ? The true story without the fictional character that Tom Cruise plays was just as intriguing . I must admit this was a good movie . It was cinematically lush and rich . The views , scenes , and camera shots were amazing and captures a spirit of Japan that is rarely seen . Hans Zimmer makes a emotionally captivating soundtrack . The costumes were well crafted period pieces . The actors gave commendable performances . I was most captivated by Ken Watanabe 's performance . His character was a beautiful balance of opposites . He was powerful yet serene , and a leader yet a servant , a rebel yet was dedicated to the emperor . This was a tumultuous time in Japan 's history in which tradition clashed with modernization . The tragic story would have been just as amazing without the fictional character that Cruise plays . I found it hard to believe that a soldier caught and held prisoner for one winter would be able to master swordsmanship to the point that he could stalemate a samurai who has been studying for all his life . Details like that disappoint me . Even in a story as epic as Last Samurai , there had to be a Caucasian meddling in the middle of it all . Loosely based on the life of Siago Takamori , the movie is overall a good film . My criticism is that the movie suggests that Cruise 's character is the Last Samurai . In a final scene the whole regiment of Japanese imperial soldiers bow down to a fallen Kastumoto . Algren holds the samurai , yet it appears that the whole of the troops are bowing to Algren ! I am disappointed that this story would not have been even told had there not been a Caucasian character to sell box office tickets .",m,1
"In DANCES WITH WOLVES 1990 , Kevin Costner is the emotionally drained Civil War soldier whose life is renewed on the Great Plains by a wild wolf and a band of Sioux when he adopts the lifestyle and values of the latter . He & quot ; goes Indian & quot ; . < p > As this film opens in 1876 , ex-Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise , formerly of the 7th Cavalry , is an alcoholic Civil War and Plains Indian War veteran reduced to making public appearances on behalf of the Winchester Arms Company , maker of the famous repeating rifle . He 's rescued by his old commanding officer , Col . Benjamin Bagley Tony Goldwyn , who arranges for Algren to help train the Japanese Imperial Army in modern warfare techniques . The pay is $ 500 per month . Because of an incident in the campaign against the Indians that still causes Algren nightmares , cost him his self-perceived honor , and drove him to drink , Nathan tells his ex-CO that he 'll kill anyone in Japan for $ 500 a month , but would gladly kill Bagley for free . Army camaraderie is not all it 's cracked up to be . In any case , off both sail to Japan . < p > The Imperial government is bedeviled by rebel samurai warriors cranky about the increasing Westernization of society . In the first skirmish between Algren-trained troops and a samurai band led by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , Nathan is wounded and captured . He spends the winter in Katsumoto 's village , where he 's nursed back to health by Katsumoto 's sister , Taka Koyuki , whose husband Algren had killed in the recent battle . While a prisoner , Nathan discovers love with you-know-who and personal friendship with Katsumoto , whose life he saves at one point , and re-discovers Honor through proximity with and training in the Samurai Code . In the final confrontation between the samurai and Imperial troops led by Bagley , guess where Algren plants his standard ? It 's DANCES WITH WOLVES all over again , but without the wolf . The samurai even employ bows and arrows . < p > THE LAST SAMURAI is a well-acted , engaging story that 's shot in some beautiful scenery . Since New Zealand seems to be the location of moviemakers ' choice lately LOTR trilogy , PETER PAN , I was n't surprised to see in the ending credits that some of this film , presumably that part in the samurai village , was located there . And speaking of scenery , there 's Koyuki , a Japanese actress unknown on U . S . screens , who 's exquisite . < p > Unfortunately , the film is perhaps thirty minutes too long , and the climactic battle sequence is milked for all it 's worth - and then some - including some unnecessary slo-mo footage . The term & quot ; maudlin & quot ; comes to mind . And it 's this aspect of THE LAST SAMURAI which makes it , to me , inferior to that other action epic of 2003 , the more tightly edited MASTER AND COMMANDER . < p > THE LAST SAMURAI may win some Oscars , such as for cinematography or costuming . But , I perceive it as only one of the better films of 2003 as opposed to one of the best .",m,1
"When I saw this film at the theaters , I remember enjoying it but not thinking much of it . Now , years later , I watched it again , and I was so pleasantly surprised . The story is very dramatic , it 's beautifully photographed , and the action is breathtaking . The performances across the board are great , including what I consider a career best from Tom Cruise . It 's just really good . If you like historical dramas like Gladiator , Braveheart , or Dances with Wolves , you should really enjoy this . It 's definitely in the same league .",m,1
Not 100 % FACTUAL but a great movie with a wonderful view of changing cultural upheaval and the clash of traditional with technological,m,1
I love this movie . It is one of the best with Tom cruise . This is one that will watch more than once .,f,1
"I owned this movie before & it was stolen from my house . I was determined that I would not buy it again , but it was such a good movie I had to give in .

I am a high school student that is in love with the samurai . This movie after I saw it made me get back into the martial arts which I had quit over a decade earlier and now I am a assistant instructor . This movie is both historical correct on the sense of the last samurai killed himself . There was no Tom Cruise character but that was based on James Clavells Shogun . This movie is about a American veteran that has lost his will to live after some mishaps that he had when facing the american indians in the 1860 's . He gets recruited by the Japanese Shogun to train a modern army after Closed Door policy that had lasted for over two hundred years . The samurai are revolting because of the change and the Western nations changing Japan . Tom Cruise gets a new outlook on life when he meets the samurai and finds something he loves . This movie had me in tears b c of the history and emotion that was put into this movie . A must see film and a must buy film .,m,1
"This movie was a masterpiece . I felt it should have deserved more credit for what it received . One of Tom Cruise 's best performances of all-time . A GREAT story that was well told of a long forgotten group of warriors in Japan who fought and served with honor , excellence , and discipline with a purpose . Their duty lies in their name - Samurai=to serve . The most sophisticated warrior of its time . The scenes shot in the movie were picture perfect and awe-inspiring for admirers of Japanese culture and Japanese history . A story of West meets Far East . Tom Cruise 's ignorant , cocky , character from the West leads to a humbling experience when he learns to live with the Samurai and understand their way of life . He reveals that they were not a barbaric people but instead a sophisticated society that lived in discipline . Opposite of what the West had perceived of the Samurai image . I recommend anyone to this movie and if you didnt know it will open up a new perception of a people who lived long ago .",m,1
"After seeing all of the movies nominated for Best Picture 2003 , and just watching The Last Samurai last night , I feel that this movie not to mention its actors was greatly overlooked by the Academy . Cruise is spectacular as the disillusioned 7th Cavalry Captain who finds his place among Katsumoto 's Ken Watanabe . . who should have won an Oscar as well rebel band of samurai 's who are fighting to keep their tradition alive in a time when Japan is looking to become more westernized . This movie has a little bit of something in it for everyone and I highly recommend it . . .",f,1
"This film started out interesting and good , and then just became `` Top Gun '' . While interesting historically , this film lacked everything else , and just followed the basic `` Hollywood '' formula . It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise 's character a troubled , raging alcoholic could learn the art & skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time . The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun , just like `` Days of Thunder '' , and I was rolling my eyes towards the end . It sounds great on a home theater system , but this is'nt one I 'd want to buy & keep forever . Buy & own at your own risk , but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like `` The Seven Samuri '' .",m,0
"The Last Samurai is an inspiring , artistic , touching movie . It even manages to stay pretty close to the historical facts it 's based on . The premise of the movie is anything but new , even so , it 's a unique production . It offers insight into the japanese culture and we , the audience , take it in through the senses of the main character , Nathan Allgren [ Tom Cruise ] . We learn about the samurai , honor , trust , pursuit of perfection and harmony , discipline and tradition , all adjectives that make Japan what it is today . There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed . A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [ less gab , more shooting one might say ] . The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action . It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down-to-earth . Almost forgot to mention the movie 's soundtrack . Absolutely brilliant , the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music . Beautiful . All in all , I absolutely loved this movie and is now part of my DVD collection . It 's one of the few titles I would enjoy watching again once in a while .",m,1
"Ken Watanabe is amazing ! ! With his laconic & quot ; I like this Custer & quot ; he encapsulates everything that is both wonderful and horrible about the code of Bushido . < p > The cinematography is great , especially in all the battle scenes . The scene when the samurai charge through the mist at the conscripts , but at first all you see is their fearsome outlines , WOW ! The scenes in the village when the samurai are training , and later , when the young archer holds off the ambush , are also beautifully shot . < p > The attention to detail in the costuming is fantastic . Ngila Dickson definitely deserves her two Oscar nominations , and could have won for either Samurai or ROTK . < p > But Tom Cruise was completely the wrong choice for his character . He is such a modern icon that he simply can not play a period role . Everything about him looks , voice , movement stopped the movie dead in its tracks . < p > And some of the script was pretty lame , but this was the kind of movie you look at , not listen to . Subtitles over Hans Zimmer 's always-great soundtrack would n't have been a bad choice .",f,0
"wow , this movie was great . . . im serious , everyone should watch this movie . it was brilliant . It 's about Tom Cruise , he starts to train a Japanese army and then during a battle between his troop and the saumrai he killed a samurai and then he is taken prisoner with the samurai but they are kind to him and stuff . well eventually , he makes friends and what not with the samurai and he goes to battle on their side . i cryed so hard in so many parts of the movie . it was just so beautiful . and i laughed at some of tom 's lines . he really isnt such a bad actor nd this is by far his best movie yet . and the action scenes being a tru fan of patriot , braveheart , and saving private ryan were filmed really well . it 's true , this may not depicted what it was really like but i dont know why so many people are criticizing this movie . alot of people are saying its an insult to japanese to think that an american is the last samurai after a little while of learning . calm down ! my best friend is asain and she cryed and loved the movie ! it was not insulting to her nor her mother ! i wouldnt mindif americans were wiped out in battle and the only one left was an asain who adopted western ways . i 'd be proud that soeone survived and passed on the legacy of my people . that whole idea is a bunch of racist crap and stop overreacting ! ! ! ! i didnt think the movie was slow either . every part was beautiful and filled with depth and emotion . there was no way the editor could delete ANY scenes that were in the finished product because they were all necessary and lets face it . . . BRILLIANT ! and alot of people are saying the characters werent well developed but cant u see : their relationship with tom says a thousand words . alot of peolpe dont understand why the wife of the samurai that tom killed and tom slept together either . . . unromantic fools ! didnt u see the tension ! omgomgomg . . . their relationship was an element htat is inexplicable , yes . . . but still , its there and its beautifula and some things in life are better left alone and unexplained . . . in conclusion , may i say again : I LOVE THIS MOVIE . . . the dvd contains gr8 special features , too ! and anyone who thinks this movie is anything less of gr8 is an idiot who doesnt know a movie from a mojo . . . buy it buy it buy it ! ! ! ! ! NOW ! ! ! < p > anyone who loves historical movies , action movies , funny movies , dramas , or any kind of movie at all . . . this is a must have in ur collection !",f,1
"It 's unfortunate that some people dont see the true beauty of this film , like me if you are a anime fan you should see it . The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it 's almost unbelievable . Even though the story is fake the families involved and the events that make this story come to life are all historic facts . These men died in battle and even know they died they died to get their point across and to be heard when they needed to be heard the most . It was a fight that could n't be won but to these men it was either fight and die proud or run and you would be forced to kill yourself and die a coward , they died and the rest of their family lived to fight another day . Tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men samurai who made this movie great . To end this some peolple need to be told that before watching this movie dont mistake it for a fraud because some people expect Tom cruse to be the last samurai and seeing that he is not of japanese descent that might bother some people and it 's nothing like that because I judged this movie before seeing it and I was dead wrong and suprised at what saw and loved this movie .",m,1
"Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor 's forces in 1876-1877 . This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story . Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography , it 's bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script . Retired Captain Nathan Algren Tom Cruise is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars . Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis Tony Goldwyn , Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan 's forces along the modern standards of 1875 . Arriving in Japan , Algren 's informed that the Emperor 's traditional samurai warriors and their leader Ken Watanabe oppose all attempts to modernize Japan . Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons , the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons . Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor , Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand . This was a good story that just never seemed to soar . This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue . Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode ? Although a film about samurai warriors , the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake . The dialogue is contrived and superficial : exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture . In conclusion , the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been . Here , a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film . The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script . For a true rendition of the samurai code and feudal Japan , I would recommend films by Akira Kurosawa instead such as 'Ran ' , 'Kagemusha ' , or 'The Seven Samurai . '",m,0
"I can not say enough good things about this movie so I will try to keep it short . Set in 19th century Japan a single group of samurai is all that is left of a once fearsome and noble tradition , and Tom Cruise ends up staying with them . I do not want to say much more about the story , unlike some other reviewers , because it is impossible to tell as well as the film does . I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan . Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal ! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far . Also , his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions . As for the fighting , there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed . Speaking of blood , the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent , they really bring the action to life . The anamorphic widescreen format is the icing on the cake . Packed with incredible fights and battles , breathtaking cinematography , and violence up the yin-yang I know that is chinese The Last Samurai is a must have for any movie fan !",m,1
"The degree to which I loved this film was really surprising . It is a film of epic proportions . The viewer is treated to a slice of historical fiction that , thanks to the second accompanying DVD , examines the degree the filmmakers qwent to guarantee the accuracy of the time period through the actors , the scenary , the costumes and more . This movie is about a used up war Captain down on his luck who gets the opportunity to make a good deal of money by selling what he has left to offer - that being his lifetime of warring , of making war and of studying war . He is perpetually haunted by the memories of his time serving under General Custer when he was ordered to murder innocent Native Americans , women and children , who he knew were innocent at the time they were slaughtered . He became an alcoholic . So the Captain is provided with this opportunity to go to Japan and train the newly developing Japanese army with the intention of defeating the old Samarai warriors who have been the protectors of the Japanese people for over 1000 years . The young Emperer is being pushed into the modern times . As a result , the Captain becomes exposed to the ways of the Samarai . The story is absolutely captivating . < p > Though I usualy do n't do this , I watched the accompanying DVD with the special features . I was glad I did because throughout the film I reflected back on what I saw and heard . During the first 15 minutes I did n't think I 'd like the film and I also had a hard time dealing with Tom Cruise as the Captain , but I knew shortly thereafter that I would be purchasing the movie on DVD . There 's just so much to see in this film and from so many different aspects that I want to be able to own and watch this movie whenever I 'd want as well as share and encourage my friends and family to see it as well .",f,1
"I enjoyed the Last Samurai . I wo n't pretend to be a professional cinema critic and , therefore , can not have an informed opinion about things like the cinematography , so I 'll mention in brief what I do know . < p > Positives : -Ken Watanabe delivers a phenomenal performance as Katsumoto . -Costume design is not only beautiful , but largely accurate . -Very entertaining as a whole , although people expecting a Braveheart level of action may be disappointed , as the battles are perforated with quieter moments of plot development and character insight . -Many small details were nailed down with pinpoint accuracy , such as the combat stances and strikes of the samurai , the differences in speaking proficiency and dialects used between age groups and social groups amongst the Japanese . -No gratuitous Taka nude scenes , geisha-esque stereotypes , etc . < p > Negatives : -Some portions of the script are needlessly saccharine although I fell for them and cried like a baby : naming it does n't make it ineffective . -The movie does drag at times , although I only noticed this after having seen it three or four times . -Tom Cruise , although he does a good job , constantly seems anachronistic , especially in contrast to other casting choices . -Returning to the saccharine point , the movie often seems to be caught up in its own power especially near the ending . -Some historical event inaccuracy , although the level of inaccuracy depends on whose accounts you 've read and believed . < p > Misc . Notes : -The title , & quot ; The Last Samurai , & quot ; is plural : do n't look for one man as & quot ; The Last Samurai , & quot ; as you 'll be disappointed . -Yes , yes , & quot ; Dances with Wolves & quot ; had the same basic premise , get over it .",m,1
"This movie is about the honor of a disappearing culture falling to the ever enchroaching imperial world in both 19th Century America and Europe . It is about the Samurai who are no longer needed in a Westernized Japan and symbolizes the culture of Japan as it is swallowed up by Western Imperialism in the 19th Century . < p > The movie centers around Captain Algren Tom Cruise , an ex-American Civil War soldier and Indian fighter who has lost his honor and is disillusioned about the world he lives in . Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet . Algren is sent to Japan by America to train the Imperial Japanese army in the way of Western warfare and weaponry . This sets up the confrontation between the Samurai , who are defending their dying culture , and Algren , who is trying to destroy that culture . Algren is captured by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , the Samurai leader , in the battle . While in capitivity , Algren learns the way of the Samurai and comes to respect the dying culture . < p > Many people say this is just a rip off of Kevin Costner 's Dances With Wolves . It is n't . This is a vastly different storyline with a similiar idea that can be seen in Dances With Wolves . The two are different stories . < p > The production values of this movie are great and well directed by Edward Zwick Glory . Definitely the a great directed movie . My hat is off to the crew that made this happen . < p > Yes , there are historical accuracies in the film , but besides Gods and Generals and Gettysburg , how many films are historical accurate ? Not many and if they were they would probably be rather boring to many . On this DVD is a documentary about the true story of the Last Samurai by the History Channel . So if you are worried about historical inaccuracies then you can get the real tale in the documentary on the special features disc . < p > All in all a great movie about a dying culture and how some people wo n't simple [ surrender ] themself to save their life and lose their culture .",m,1
"A very well crafted movie , with so many parallels to the spiritual life , especially the priesthood .

A samurai is an Asian Japanese knight . It was a decent action adventure flick . Worth renting once or twice . Tom Cruise 's fame does n't do much to heighten the film sceptic 's disbelief .

"Rolling in late December 2003 , this movie surprised me a great deal . I did n't know how deep it would try and be , or how good the storyline or action was . I may hear people complain about a few plot holes , but give the movie a break , guys . This is definitely one of Tom Cruise 's best outings . One of his most emotional performances is given here . Ken Watanabe is astounding as the leader of the samurai clan that take Civil War vet Capt . Nathan Aulgren Cruise into their clan as a P . O . V . but he eventually learns to like their culture and becomes a samurai himself . The landscape of the movie is beautiful , and Hans Zimmer 's score plays gloriously in the background . The movie really makes you eventually hate the & quot ; modern & quot ; enemy of a modernized Japan , with a fully-equipped legion of American-trained soldiers , Nathan 's old enemy from back home , and the leader of the new brand of soldiers . This leads to an all-out war between the samurai and the new Japan and it is an incredible scene when these two go at it , definitely one of my favorite movie war scenes of all-time . The DVD is a fully-loaded 2 disc-set , boasting impressive video quality and audio quality on the first one with 2 . 35:1 and Dolby Digital 5 . 1 soundtrack I would 've liked a DTS though , and impressive special features on the second disc that further immerse you in the world of old Japan . < p > Definitely a very powerful , albeit a bit fictitious , film . Spoiler coming up -- -- -- -- < p > we all know Tom Cruise died on the battlefield .",m,1
"This movie is a good one , but it could have been much better . If you go in expecting a period action piece , you will not be disappointed . Those expecting something along the line of `` Braveheart '' be warned . Tom Cruise is enjoyable , but he gives his standard performance . Which is to say that you do not see a character like he is capable of giving , such as Ron Kovic in `` Born on the 4th of July '' or even Lestat in `` Interview with the Vampire . `` Instead you get Tom Cruise as an angst-ridden , recovering alcoholic that looks great in a kimono . But the performance still works , it 's just shame about the missed potential . Ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist-turned-outlaw who tries to hold on to the outdated beliefs of the samurai . The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it 's one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film . As well as the much too short screen time of Billy Conelly and Tony Goldwyn . The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations . < p > Unfortunately this film buys into it 's own granduer , and it falls short on that level . There are some great moments in the film , do n't get me wrong . Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film . Even when you know what the outcome will be . But that 's where the film should have ended . Instead you get another ten minutes of an eye rolling , very sappy resolution . I 'm not sure if this was the product of Zwick or the suits at WB , but does not work . Another scene I found difficult to swallow was an assassination attempt . Great fight choreography , great action , but awkwardly placed and no justification for it . You can almost hear a studio exec say `` This is Japan . So where are the ninjas ? `` If the gunpowder obsessed emperor and cronies sent the assassins , which is whom you assume sent them why did they use ninjas instead of rifleman ? Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords . It 's because it makes for a great action scene , that 's why , and the audience will eat it up . < p > The film is good and I recommend it . But be warned that at times it comes across as very contrived . I was hoping for an epic , instead I got a really good action flick . Three stars instead four due to studio induced Oscar pandering",m,0
"I was surprised that I actually liked this one , particularly since it seemed to promise just another run-of-the-mill action adventure period piece . Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same . Still I did n't expect to enjoy this hybrid eastern-western that reworked Japanese history in order to put a dissolute and despondent American war hero who 's tortured by what he did in the Indian wars that followed on the Civil War into the era of Japanese modernization . Tom Cruise always seems to me to be too cuddly to play such roles and yet I thought he pulled this one off . The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute . That he takes to the Samurai lifestyle and weapons handling practices so readily is a bit hard to believe though the film does a good job of dragging out the learning process enough so that it does n't look too precipitous . Of course , the American is only with his captors for a few months so it 's a little hard to accept that he manages to become expert in Japanese swordsmanship in so short a span . But the film makes it look convincing and that 's usually enough in this kind of thing . The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord , Katsuomoto , who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed . Although there was little that was unexpected , Katsoumoto 's escape from his enemies at the emperor 's court was probably the high point and the least predictable in the film 's repertoire of scenes . I 'd see this one again for its ambience and tight storytelling , even if it did n't ultimately swallow me up , which , on my view , is the true measure of a great film .

"`` The Last Samarai '' is one of the greatest films released in 2003 , starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe . Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences ' eyes wide open through the whole movie . Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant . Despite the war themes , there are some great heartwarming scenes , namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles . As he begins learning Japanese traditions , he begins learning more about himself , which plays a crutial part in the film . As this develops , the drama also develops , which keeps audiences interested . This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was . His friends ' life stories add an additional unique flavor . The war scenes are uniquely intense . Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery . This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict . < p > Its Oscar-nominated 1870 's Japanese setting is flawless . They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set . The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects . The costumes are accurate from those times . Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film . < p > Tom Cruise 's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years . His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off . He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second . The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it . Ken Watanabe 's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight . This performance makes acting appear easy when it 's actually the opposite . He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years . All other actors also performed their roles beautifully . < p > '' The Last Samarai '' is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion . This is sure to please many audiences . This is destined to be a classic in the following years as it deserves .",m,1
"After reading some of the reviews here , I was not expecting too much from this movie , but thought I would give it a try anyway . I was truly surprised , it was VERY well done , the acting and story line were far more solid then I had expected . This movie delievered far more then I expected . < p > So all I really have to say , is give this movie a try , I doubt you will be disapointed .",m,1
"This movie has action , drama , story , great cinematography and good acting . The fight sequences are well choreographed . The story is deep and has soul . It gave me that feel like when I saw dances with wolves and fighting spirit like Gladiator . This movie will bring the Warrior out of you once you get into it ! < p > If , like me you love Epics , History , Martial arts and ZEN stuff , You 'll enjoy this movie hopefully .",m,1
"This film is definately on the top of my favorite movie list . Tom Cruise does a beautiful job portraying a Civil War veteran that is having a lot of difficulty accepting what occured in his past . He goes to Japan for a job of training a modern Japanese army fighting the last of the samurai that are rebeling against the ways of the government , but still fighting for the emperor . He ends up becoming a part of the warriors he was training to kill , and so begins the epic tale of Nate Algren . A memorable line that the charecter Nathan Algren states at the beginning of the movie is this : You want me to kill Jappos , I 'll kill Jappos . Colonel Bagley : I 'm not asking you to kill anybody . Algren : & quot ; You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos , I 'll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos . . . Rebs , The Souix , The Cheyenne . . . For $ 500 a month I 'll kill whoever you want . But keep one thing in mind , I 'd gladly kill you for free . & quot ; Really makes you wan na hang around this guy , huh ? The acting is amazing , Ken Watanbe plays a cool headed philosopher type samurai that has interesting and touching ideas . This movie is definatly one that is worth seeing . For sure a five star movie .",f,1
This is the best damn tom cruise ever . I forgot that was tom and believed he was capt . nathan algren . this movie is a masterpiece . forget that review above and watch this instant classic .,m,1
"This is my favorite non-trilogy movie RotK is actually my truly favorite , and while I respect anyone who loves this movie and gives it 5 stars , I must say that none of these reviews gives this movie any justice ! They tell you the basic story . . . an alcoholic Civil War guy . . . enemy . . . samurai ! While that is the story . . . there 's a lot more to it than that ! What captivated me and all my friends 17 - 21 years old was the Samurai . . . and , all the emotions of the story . . . an American kills the Red Samurai . . . who is the Samurai Captains Brother-in-law . . . he lives in the house and is cared for by the Red Samurai 's widow . . . Tom Cruise sees the beauty of the Samurai people and understands the honor and respect and culture and discipline of these people and realizes they are not the enemy ! He learns a lot from these people and earns their respect in many ways ! The widow . . . who knows Cruise killed her husband . . . offers the Red armor for Cruise to fight with Samurai against the Army Cruise was sent to train ! Beautiful movie in every way ! It is no way slow at any point ! When someone says this movie is `` slow '' , it simply means they do not feel the emotion of silence and music and the visuals they see ! The battles are a very small part in the greatness of this movie ! But , the end of the last battle will have you reaching for a hanky ! The Samurai are a beautiful people ! Also recommended are Samurai books and old classic Japanese Samurai movies ! . . . unless you think it 'll be . . . slow !",m,1
This is a Great Movie And i love it . The price for it is cheap so it is a Must Buy ! !,m,1
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAM OF THE OLD MEETS THE NEW AND EAST MEETS WEST . ALSO A GOOD EXAM OF THE MAIN CHARAXCTER DEALING WITH HIS OWN PROBLEMS .,m,1
I liked it . The ending was n't bad . A lot more of the movie was spoken in English than I was expecting . The swordfights are really realistic and graphic . It 's something that Jackie Chan would n't have even been able to handle . There was a fairly decent number of parallels with Dances with Wolves .,m,1
"I ca n't stand Tom Cruise , but he sure was a hottie in this film . It 's amazing what long hair on a guy and losing the whole Scientology thing can do for a person . . . . Anway , 1 I agreed with the whole sad Native American slaughter tragedy-the fact that it was horrible and I ca n't believe people actually did that . 2 Loved the scenery in Japan 3 Still do n't ca n't relate to the whole Japanese obsession with `` honor '' that is actually pride Does n't the Bible say that pride goeth before a fall ? ? ? ? This movie was worth watching , but I would n't watch it again as it was way too sad . I can appreciate all the effort that went in to making this film",m,0
"This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves ! It 's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais ! ! Of course , this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves , more warfare , more cool fights and more blood ! ! ! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action , the story is a little predictable but still interesting . P . S : If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances , but basically they are the same . Adios .",m,1
Even with all the negative attention Cruise has been garnering lately it 's hard to see why people would n't see this film . The movie is romantic and fanciful . It is somewhat ridiculous and over the top but also elegant . The fighting scenes are dead on and actually quite beautiful . By far though the star of this movie is Ken Watanabe . If for no other reason you should see this movie just because Billy Connolly is in it .,m,1
"This movie is excellent in conveying a different and needed perspective about Japan at this period of history . Much can be learned . Unfortunately , I am reading reviews from people that wanted a typical Tom Cruise action movie . They were expecting a formula based on action , clever plot twists , and more action . This does not require an effort to understand the beauty of another culture . One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese , and therefore not acting . After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies , this one is a slice way above the rest . Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision . His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film . He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren . This chemistry was special throughout the film . This is a formula that includes real story telling , action , a demand to stretch your understanding , and more action . Therefore , the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad . I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie , and knowing it became a personal project . It does remind me of Kevin Costner and `` Dances with Wolves . `` I am sorry to see a less culturally open minded audience in 2004 , outside of the Japanese American communities .",m,1
One aspect I really like in this movie is it 's portrayal of PTSD in Cruise 's character . I recommend it to family members of returning war veterans .,m,1
Great performance of Tom cruise . . . I am not a big fan of him but I just love this movie .,m,1
"In short , great film to say the least and the music Hans Zimmer is excellent and blends perfectly with the movie .",m,1
"Imagine you are a woman living in the United States , and a foreign fighter Pick any of the convenient enemies - The Soviets , Al Qaida , The French , etc invades your town , killing your husband and trying to destroy your very way of life . Imagine again , that within 6 months , he has learned everything there is to know about being an American , and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen . So dedicated is he to his new `` family '' , that he even goes into battle wearing your dead husband 's uniform . Did I mention that you have fallen madly in love with him ? If this sounds too far-fetched to be true , imagine the same story , only you are Japanese , a race and culture renowned for excluding outsiders and foreigners , as well as a culture that is almost impenetrable in its subtlety . Unbelieveable , is n't it ? Apparently , not if you 're Tom Cruise .",m,0
"Reading this may ruin your viewing of the movie , Last Samurai , by forwarning you of what it is about . < p > The latest Tom Cruise movie , The Last Samurai is a terrific movie -- portraying the role of big business in pushing for and aiding in the elimination of a native culture that was not supportive of trade and commerce , in this case , in Japan . And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple , less technological natives . Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character , asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial , US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais . He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing , the noble thing to do . < p > Why do n't we see American warriors standing up . It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out . But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud , built on lies and stupid unpreparedness . Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait , who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been . < p > The movie was one of the best of the year , with Oscar caliber acting , script , set , and costumes , in a season with a plethora of disappointing films . I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted -- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays , disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures . I write this as a liberal who publishes a liberal news and opinion website op ed news dot com . I 'm curious how conservatives viewed this flick .",m,1
"I went to a `` sneak preview '' tonight and came away a bit underwhelmed . It 's not the worst movie I 've ever sat through ; I found myself checking my watch only a few times wondering how much more I had to sit through . A few interesting characters I liked Ken Watanabe , but nothing really original . Cliche upon cliche . A yawner mostly , but it will entertain people who have not seen any other movies . < p > For me personally , the most remarkable thing about the movie is how fake the sets and special effects looked . Sailing into Yokohama harbor looks ridiculous . A street scene at night in Tokyo where Tom Cruise is surrounded by swordsmen looked entirely like it had been filmed afterhours at Universal Studios in Orlando . Many of the entirely predictable battle scenes look like they are just hundreds of actors outdoors pretending to kill each other . It will be interesting to study these scenes in freeze frame on DVD to see what everybody was doing .",m,0
"A very promessing film , The Last Samurai talks about something that is sacred to many of us : Honor . The willingness to live in accordance with a code honor in all aspects of life . This is shurelly depicted in the conflict beetwen two very different universes and ages . Tom Cruise 's character is ecxactly like this . His niilism and desilusion with the west is replaced by respect and ultimatly union , when he fights the samurai for the first time . Being captured by the enemy he actually finds his peers . All of these men and women become his brothers and sisters living under one of thinking that is juste like his . Looking at the trailer i can garantee a superb blockbuster i tell this .",m,1
Not right for the academy . It 's not bad I here they shot it with digital . I 'm not sure how I feel about that . Bette luck next time Tom,f,0
"Absolutely beautiful . I have not enjoyed the few movies Cruise had done just prior to this movie from Eyes Wide Shut on , they were pretty gross , disturbing , or just awful . . . and I 'm a total Cruise fan . So , hearing that he was going to be in a movie like this , I groaned and thought , `` Damn . I wish he 'd done this movie five years ago . He 'll probably ruin it now . `` But hey , I 'm a total Japanese culture lover , so I figured I 'd watch it anyway . I thought I was disappointed with the movie when it began , because they set up the plot very slowly , and lay out a large amount of information that seems irrelevant . But , like the quiet slice of sword through air , the pieces began to come together , and I found myself enraptured with the film . Ken Watanabe Katsumoto 's presence on the screen is breathtaking , as were his family and friends . Taka , the heroine , was beautiful in her silence , and the scene with her and Tom at the end was . . . well , unforgettable . Omura is excellent and , like the rest of those mentioned here , enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression . Nobutada the archer was , I believe , my favorite character outside of Watanabe . His final scene had me sobbing . But I think most impressive is the way that Tom Cruise does n't dominate this film . It 's almost as if he , like his character , is enraptured and humbled by these people , and he 's purposefully pulling himself in , so that THEY shine on screen . Overall , an absolutely spectacular film . It 's perhaps a bit too intelligent for some , a bit too poignant for others . It is , however , a film that I hope will inspire others . Its lessons are vast . I only wish there were a prequel , so that I could see Katsumoto , Taka , Nobutada , and Omura more , and in all their glory .",m,1
"Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love . At first i though that this movie would be a waste of money , but i was very wrong . Even though i hate extreme violence this movie was an exception .",m,1
But never really hooks the viewer . Good action but contrived .,m,1
"The scenery and set are the best part of the movie , as are the Japanese actors and actresses . The plot is entertaining . Then Tom Cruise comes in and plays , . . . Tom Cruise . He is a looser ex-military drunk who ends up in Japan and teaches this ancient warrior class how to fight . Cruise ' ego once again is center screen , the pretty boy who ca n't act ruins another good movie .",f,0
"Plain and simple if you like action this movie is for you . If you like drama this movie is for you . If you like foriegn this movie is for you . iTs my favorite move , and Tom Cruise is awsome in this movie .",m,1
"This movie was the greatest movie I 've ever seen , it will continue to be my favorite movie for a long time . The war sequences were far better than any other movie like 'Saving Private Ryan ' . The Last Samurai had better special affects and a most intriguing story . I loved the relationship between Algren and the Samurai class , the fight for survival in the newly modernized country Japan after 1868 when Meiji 's reign as Emperor began . Its quite fascinating how this story , even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out . The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo , or `` Dai Saigo '' otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role , a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play . The honor and prestige that each warrior felt back in history was shown in the faces of the individuals that gave their time and skills into making this film historically memorable . I love to read about Japanese history , and I can say right now that they did a spectacular job in recreating the nation of Japan back in the times of Meiji . domo arigatou . . . . . ja ne !",f,1
I held this one off for a long time . I was at the very bottom of my list of movies to see . I just knew it was gon na be trash . Aside from some breathtaking photography this film is dumbed down Hollywood trash . An insult to Japanese filmakers like Akira Kurosawa Seven Samurai and Hiroshi Inagaki Samurai Trilogy who 's Samurai films have captured the hearts of audeinces worldwide . < p > Not only is this film a rip off of those directors but it 's also a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood epics like Braveheart . Probably the worst thing about this film is Tom Cruise 's occaisional narration of his diary . What kind of warrior keeps a diary anyway ? Is n't that for pansies ? Anyway it serves as pointless drivel that mearly point 's out the allready obvious . It 's like they tried to make this film idiot proof . I think they should have focused on making it average joe jane pissed off cause they spent 5 bucks to rent this crap proof . < p > The Characater development in this film was pretty much the same any Jean Claued Van Damme film . Last time I checked & quot ; Kickboxer & quot ; or & quot ; Bloodsport & quot ; did n't get nominated for any Academy Awards . I was just waiting for a training montage . < p > That 's all I 'm gon na write about this film . I have better stuff to review .,m,0
"This film fails both historically and morally . The real Imperial Army was not inept and cowardly as shown in this film . Every Japanese history textbook I 've ever read says that the conscript soldiers were disdained by the haughty samurai , but that they proved their bravery and worth in the battles against them . There 's nothing in this film that shows the arrogance and contempt the samurai had for the & quot ; dirt farmers & quot ; whom they expected to easily defeat , but who stood their ground and shot them to pieces . The samurai , incidentally , had just as many cannons and muskets as their opponents . I can not understand why the filmmaker had to make the samurai 's enemies so evil and stupid , instead of portraying the war as a sincere clash of cultures between men who fought for what they belived in . Morally , it really hurt me to see Tom Cruise Algren wading so cold-bloodedly into the teenage troops he had been training six months ago and butchering them without the slightest compunction . And there was n't even any sort of remorse voiced by Cruise Algren , even in a cliched , off-the-cuff sort of way & quot ; Many brave men on both sides will die today . & quot ; . Maybe he hacked to death that poor , scared man he was trying to teach how to shoot earlier in the film . This is one of those films that , like & quot ; The Patriot & quot ; , gets every cuff button and chin-strap of the costumes right , but fails to capture the spirit of an era and its people by resorting to black-and-white good-and-evil cliches . It looks geat , but has a rotten core .",m,0
"At every opportunity this movie failed in the presentation of its larger themes . To begin with , the presentation of honor , as illustrated through the statements and military tactics of the rebel samurai leader , demonstrated a grotesque misunderstanding of the term . The idea that honor somehow requires a military leader to ignore cutting edge military technology , i . e . firearms , or to blindly charge forward at a numerically superior and better armed foe is laughable . Furthermore , the healing power of love can hardly be demonstrated by a widow who jumps in bed with her husband 's killer before his corpse is even cold , even if the killer is Tom Cruise . On a side note , I could hardly restrain my laughter when Cruise 's character appears in the doorway of the widow 's house wearing her husband 's armor . Regarding the below comments about the racially insensitive aspects of this movie , I completely agree . If I was Japanese , I would be annoyed at how Tom Cruise 's American character , after spending only a short time in the samurai village , ultimately holds himself out to be the highest exponent of the samurai virtues and then presumes to instruct the Emperor on how to act . I get hot under the collar when Europeans comment about how Americans should act or vote . I can only imagine that people of Japanese citizenship or descent would have a similar reaction to the manner in which samurai culture was depicted in this film .",m,0
"`` Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure '' , is a simple way to describe this movie . I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out . I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick 's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well . Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie , Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely `` factless '' . America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army , they at the time had the best Foot soldiers . Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways , He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did , he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind . The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered `` RONIN '' meaning Samurai with no master , and sense Samurai means `` To serve '' they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable . The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms ; it was not the Bows vs . Rifles you see in the movie . And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government , quit the opposite is true . Japan had been divided for more then a century ; the clans had known nothing but war . When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace . The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan , the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai , They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai , ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai . It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan . Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete , but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power , status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests . This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history . I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film , I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors the real history of Japan .",m,0

"In 1876 , Nathan Algren Tom Cruise is living in a bottle . He is a Captain in the U . S . Army who is so ashamed of the things he did in the Indian Wars under Gen . Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories . Unable to keep a job , he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man . Along with a few other military officers , including his old Colonel Tony Goldwyn , whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders , and Algren 's friend Zebulon Gant Billy Connolly , he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare . Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism , and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai , who believe that by modernizing , Japan is losing its sense of self . The Samurai , led by Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values . After the first battle , the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors , and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself . Sensing his strength , Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied . While in Katsumoto 's village , Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai , including their discipline , their loyalty , and most importantly for Algren , their serenity . This was a great film ; it dealt with loyalty , moral ambiguity , and courage . The story , while somewhat predictable , was a good one to tell . However , this story probably is not very accurate , but that can be overlooked . There are some logic problems Algren learned Japanese FAST , but once again , they do n't detract from this great film .",m,1
"This movie was filmed in Australia and not like Japan at all , there is even scene with coconut tree ! This movie is Japan from eyes of American , not bushido , NOT TRUE SAMURAI , not the heart of Japan . Japanese emperor and bushido are not heterogenous , this movie mislead of Japan conception . Why ninja attacking village ? Was this still playing active part in Japan which became Meiji ? -No . The scene when children eat meal without having a rice bowl in left hand , this is very ill mannered in Japanese meal , and this also Samurai 's child ? -No . To say `` This Hollywood film drew the heart of Japan or samurai correctly '' is profanity to the samurai who fought for the resturation of Japan . -- - A rental is enough , I think we see only one time even if we buy it .",m,0
"i may pick this film , but I think that certain things take away from the overall story . first , i think it would have been better completely without Tom Cruise 's character . Just Ken Watanabe 's character . Secondly , there was this one part where you watch Tom Cruise fight some guys , then directly after , you have to watch it over again . it was supposed to add dramatic effect , but i hated it . i already saw it once , why do i have to see it again ? finally , the ending sucked . it was just Tom Cruise acting like he was an angry drunk and it did n't make any sense why he did n't die . Ken Watanabe 's character was actually cool , why did he die and Tom Cruise live ? other than that , it was a pretty good film .",m,0
"First off , The Good : The cinematography , though sometimes almost TOO glossy slick for it 's own good , is consistently excellent , but then it is by John Toll Braveheart , The Thin Red Line so no surprise there . Ken Watanabe is fine , noble , strong yet vulnerable and easily out-acts Cruise without breaking a sweat . He does more with a glance than Cruise can do with his whole grunting straining scowling arsenal of Master Thespian Acting tricks . In fact most of the Japanese cast is uniformly above average . Some of the battle sequences were intense and well staged , particularly the Ninja attack , but to even begin to compare them with Braveheart , as some reviewers have done here , invites incredulity . The Bad : Hans Zimmer 's music nearly overwhelms several scenes in the worst sledgehammer way , underlining and cueing the audience into what emotion they should be feeling in every scene instead of merely setting and enhancing mood . Contrast this with the same composer 's outstanding score for The Thin Red Line incidentally a FAR superior film in every respect about men in battle war self-conflict . Then there 's Mr . Tom Cruise . . . what to say about pretty boy ? He wants that bloody Oscar SO BAD you can see him straining with the effort in nearly every scene . Several times I thought that bulging vein in his forehead was simply going to burst right there on screen . At least that would have been entertaining to watch . Cruise can be effective given the right role and a strong enough director to rein in his own worst instincts this summer 's Collateral for example . I 'm afraid Mr . Zwick was not up to the challenge . And , The Ugly : the ending . OH MY GAWD ! I saw it coming and still did n't believe it would really go there , but yup , sure enough , Our Intrepid Hero gets to lead the suicide charge , miraculously survive it , help the REAL hero commit sepuku , stare down the emperor into shame , AND make his way back to the picture-postcard lotus blossom village to shack up with the wife of the man he killed ! Alrighty then . This may have sunk to a new all time low in over-the-top , ludicrously inappropriate , spiked-on happy endings that completely invalidate everything the film has labored to create , even if unsuccessfully , for the last 150 minutes ! ! ! Honor ? If Cruise has indeed learned anything about the Samurai code of honor , he would have disemboweled himself on the last battlefield along with the other guy ! But no and I can see Mr . Cruise 's fingerprints all over this he has to be the defiant hero who overcomes all odds , redeems himself AND gets the girl too . Puh-leeze . Even though I was dissatisfied with much of what had come before , a decent ending could have at least redeemed the film somewhat . As it stands , it merely reinforced and truly unmasked The Last Samurai for the conventional Hollywood claptrap that it is .",m,0

"Beautifully shot ~~ , if only tom cruises character in this film could be , Its a good film . But a few things really grate , 1 . Cheapening of martial artslearning the art of the sword and unarmed combat in 3 months vs someone whose spent their life with it and he can draw that man in 3 months plz . wow the actor spent 8 months learning martial arts for this movie , he must be REALLY good in 8 months , like thats almost a year of training in martial arts , sword and unarmed combat . Silly me it only took me 10 years to study unarmed combat , im living in japan , and i still couldnt take on 5 people with swords . I must just be so stupid . Fact : guns kill people far more effectively than swords . It doesnt matter how much philosophy and dedication to training as soon as guns came around swords and unarmed combat took second place . 3 months film time 8 months real time does not make tom cruise or his character a ninja capable of taking on 5 trained armed assasins , he being unarmed because he lost his revolver and didnt notice . . . yeah right . That scene from Indiana jones comes to mind , sword guy meet revolver . 2 . Blatantly ripping off other films , 19th century soldier with deathwish goes native and fights for the other side , man leading horse into pasture at the end , oh plz , and savage warriors charging a disciplined army , cough cough braveheart cough . 3 . The man charges a row of gattling guns , um hello ? people dont get up and act heroic after that . They just die , Thats the point , it was the pivotal machine for empire making of the late 19th century to early 20th . 4 . Billy Connolly u cant do irish u might think u can but really u cant just play it real and scottish . this film is a 3 4 star , its an ok film , but honestly to give this 5 stars is a bit hopeful woefully uncritical written by someone with vested interest in selling it ?",m,0

"In the 19th Century Japan became part of the world . For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun . His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai . Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare . < p > The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy . To do this he imported overseas advisors , Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy . The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages . This film is about this revolt . < p > Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer . This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale . At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation . However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent . < p > Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character . That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children . This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life . In this film he is redeemed . < p > He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter . In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan . In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre . He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans . < p > The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history . The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision , as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country . Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians . < p > The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in .",m,0
"I happen to see this film tonight and for the life of me I can not fathom the near universal praise . Let me start with Mr . Cruise . While Born on the 4th revealed he had some emotional depth and especially his work in Magnolia , in this film he is absolutely awful . He runs the gamut from A to B . The opening scene where he has to act `` drunk '' I could literally `` see '' him acting . The rest of the film he has a total of three facial expressions . One ; the glowering warrior all squinting eyes and clenched jaw , noble , resolute and certain of his convictions . Two , the compassionate puppy dog either staring blankly at the widow or with supposed affection for her two boys . And lastly , the Zen look where he visualises scenes of combat or contemplates the idyllic life of the Japanese peasants . Why do so many American films have this obsession of placing caucasian males in usually exotic or third world scenarios where the White man has the duty to civilize the natives , attract the native wenches and somehow be an apologist for Vietnam , slavery , the American Indians or any socially relevant cause . This film is deeply insulting to the Japanese as it portrays them in the same old stereotypes . The xenophobic , emotionally stunted , devious and insular Asian . Beyond the superbly staged action scenes , this film is just another one off the Hollywood conveyor belt in the tradition of `` Genghis Khan '' with the original `` Top Gun '' , the Duke . As i came out of the theater I couldnt believe that they still make this kind of rubbish in 2003 .",m,0
"The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves . Once again , a formerly evil American U . S . Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U . S . imperialism . At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe . Actually , the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right . The samurai preyed on the peasants . Eventually , as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan , a new national army based on the peasantry was formed . When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges . the national army defeated them . The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history . Avoid it like the plague .",m,0
"Blu-Ray Disc is not a DVD . . . but , they are both DISCS ! HD-DVD , which is DVD , is garbage ! It holds less than 15 Gigabytes on a single layer ! Blu-Ray holds 25 Gigs !

Besides all my facts that will in time grant Blu Ray the winner of this new movie format . The Last Samurai is great on Blu Ray ! Since I first watched this movie in the theater . . . I could n't wait to watch it on Blu-Ray . . . I love this movie more . . . if that were possible ! !",m,1
"Samurai as good , honourable soldier who hold onto traditional value is like sharks in Finding Nemo who are vegetarian . It is totally FAKE . Samurai are in essense ultra-loyal soldiers for Japanese Emperior . Chinese and rest of Asia knows very well that these are people who kills civillians , children , women and anyone else if the Emperior ask them too . Modernise or not is just the weapon they take up , not the mentality they have . < p > I am so sorry and angry that Hollywood have continued to romantize the 'Japanese value ' . Do n't you people knows Japanese soldiers were like NAZI in Asia in World War ? Even worse , they never apologize for their wrong during the war . They portrait themselves as survivors of the atomic bombs , victims of the wars when they are the PREDATORS who invade other countries in the first place Why can they get away with this ? That 's because the West are so impressed by the Samuria code of HONOUR to realize it is exactly this code of unquestionable loyalty that cause so much suffering over Asia . The Last Samurai may be an epic and Tom Cruise may have made Oscar worthy performance but would you honour a film portraiting how loyal Nazi was to Hitler or how English soldiers bravely killing Native Americans ?",f,0
I am not a Tom Cruise fan . In fact I think he is a bit of a nut . But . . . after saying that this is a good performance for him . While the plot is fairly predictable I think it is an interesting look into a historical time period . A transition from an ancient tradition in Japan into the modern age . I would recommend the film to anyone who loves history .,m,1
"Brilliant performance not only from Tom Cruise but also from other Japanese actors & amp ; actress . This is a relatively long movie last over 2 . 5 hours but you wo n't find a single boring scene . The Samurai 's Bushido will really make you feel intense . The DVD comes with 2 discs . Movie is on the disc one and lots of extra goodies can be found from disc two . In addition to the regular features such as director 's commentaries , making of the Last Samurai , and deleted scenes , etc . , it also includes the Bushido 's Way , Japan Premiers , and the 25 minutes documentary from History Channel : History vs Holloywood -- - about what 's from the real history and what 's hollowoodized . Overall , excellent film , rich features !",m,1
"The story focuses on a Civil War veteran named Capt . Nathan Algren Tom Cruise . He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country 's remaining Samurai . Unfortunately , Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai , and is held prisoner by them . The leader of the Samurai , Katsumoto Ken Watanabe , is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him . As time passes , Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto . He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well , and trains to become one of them , so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them . < p > With the acception of `` Mystic River '' , `` The Last Samurai '' was my favorite film of 2003 . For 2 1 2 hours , I was literally glued to the screen , and loving every minute of it . It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film . The only downfall this film may have , is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of `` Dances with Wolves '' . However , that does not make the film any less enjoyable . In fact , `` The Last Samurai '' is almost better . The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai . They have a deeper sense of honor , and their fighting style is much more deadly . Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture , from the costume designs and simple way of life , to the weaponry and fighting style . The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since `` Braveheart '' . The Samurai are completely outnumbered , and still manage to put up one heck of a fight . Tom Cruise gave one of the best , if not the best performance of his career . However , the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe . He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior . The film 's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well . < p > Overall , `` The Last Samurai '' is an amazing film . Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately , the performances given by the actors involved were amazing , and the final battle was incredible . Also , please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set . From the look of things , the extras are reason enough to purchase this film . There are deleted scenes , featurettes on the making of the film , a featurette comparing real life Samurai , and more . This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film , and the Samurai in general . < p > A solid 5 stars . . .",m,1
"A disillusioned , alcoholic American soldier Tom Cruise hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader Ken Watanabe , but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle . This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it . It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes . The photography , costuming , and production design are astonishing , presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life . The cast is mostly excellent , especially Watanabe , who should be remembered at Oscar time . However , there are two things that work against this film . The first is Tom Cruise himself . Although he does good work here , he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character . The biggest problem is the film 's ending , which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention . Nevertheless , the things that work in this film really work well , resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature .",m,1
"This movie is wonderful in Blu-ray and DTS digital surround . These formats were created for movies with great vistas and battle scenes , which abound here . It 's a movie about honor , bravery , nobility and redemption . Along the way we have subplots including the clash of civilizations in 19th century Japan , a tender , thought-provoking love story , an action thriller and a buddy movie between the Tom Cruise character , Captain Algren and the Samurai warrior , Lord Katsumoto , played by Ken Watanabe , who gives a better performance than Cruise , IMO . I 'm not Tom Cruise 's biggest fan . I consider him to be more of a movie star than he is an actor , yet I keep finding myself watching and enjoying his movies and this is my favorite . He did a fine job in this movie , however . Not perfect but not much is . It was a difficult part , in that he had to convincingly portray a man going through major changes . The redemption I mentioned , had to have been emotionally challenging for the actor . He did all his own stunts , btw . The direction , filming and editing is as good as anything you 're going to see . The Blu-ray transfer was excellent . The sets , primarily in the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and in New Zealand were outstanding . The extras were equally outstanding , with the voice-over commentary by director Edward Zwick going more into his emotional journey with the film far more than the usual `` making of '' , although there 's plenty of that in the extras as well . I gave it 4 stars .",m,1
"A stunning story and modern classic ! Very well told and acted . The sets were incredible ! The evolution of the main character was played out perfectly , and the story within the story could n't have been better . This is a cinematic work of art !",m,1

You lost 2 episode on making a cake ? and they spend the last 2 to explain everything ! It seems like that they where told to pull the plug when there where only 2 episode left .

"This is a sci-fi action with magic thrown in .

"In terms of mindless adventure films , this one was excellent from the beginning . Plenty of action sequences , battles , and nasty terminator robots . I ca n't fault the film : it 's a generous serving of goofy fun . But it 's when you get into the subplot and the mysterious Marcus character that things start to get a little bit perplexing . Spoilers start below : spoilers From the beginning , you know something is fishy with Marcus , and there are some creative parallels suggesting he might be a terminator himself , but once the bomb is dropped and we find out that he is a strange terminator human hybrid , then the questions start rolling in . I lost sleep after this film , pondering how exactly certain problems in this scenario could be figured out . For instance , he 's a terminator with a human brain : would n't he start to question his lack of ability to eat or drink , or desire to ? And what about bathroom functions ? If you still had a human brain in a terminator body , would n't you start to question why those details do n't matter anymore ? And how could a heart function without the rest of the circulatory system , such as lungs to give the heart oxygen , or bone marrow for blood cells , etc , etc ? And if the final terminator gave Marcus a massive damaging heart punch at the end , why would that make for a healthy heart for a transfer ? And in a post-apocalpytic setting , would they even have the facilities and medicines to accomplish a heart transplant ? Even more perplexing is that the goofy robots of Cyberdyne would devise THIS sort of system to try to outsmart John Connor . Would n't it make more sense to try more time travel , and this time go after Sarah Connor 's mom , or something more linear and logical like that ? Anyhow , if you do n't read into the film , and do n't think of too deeply , it 's good fun . Seeing Michael Ironsides in action again as the , well , the Michael Ironsides character again , was a nice touch as well . But come on , did John Connor really dive into the ocean and swim into a submarine ?",m,0
"I really enjoyed this movie . I think it was the best one I saw that year . The story was straight sci fi . The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators . They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type . The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done . Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie . I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies . I think he did the alien queen in aliens . Anyway the special effect are really well done . I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place . That is when the special effects are done well . Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested . I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection . The music is done well and is very emotional . It was done by Danny Elfman . The acting and story was top notch . It is a story of sacrifice and redemption . The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional . Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character . I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer . I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie . The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role . Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role . Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone . Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this . Recommended to families to watch with children over 13 . I think the parents wo n't find anything objectionable . If you have n't seen this due to hearing that it was n't good . Give it a chance . I liked it , maybe you will too . Kevin",m,1

Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past . Good but not great . A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4 . Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter . This is where Terminator Salvation falls short . It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o . k . sequel . Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness .,f,1
"I love this movie , It is intense and very action packed . I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it .",m,1
"Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the Terminator series . It 's also the lesser of the four . The first three starred Ah-Nuld , and were great because of him . Terminator Salvation stars Christian Bale and is slightly above average in spite of him . The action is good , the Terminators are great including that one that looks identical to Arnold S . circa 1984 , but the story is n't . They just do n't make action movies the way they used to , when they not only had good action , but they also had something to entertain you even when something was n't blowing up . When nothing is being shot or blown up onscreen , Terminator : Salvation is pretty boring . Still , I 'd take Terminator : Salvation over Transformers , Iron Man 2 , and G . I . Joe .",m,0
"This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators , know it , but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs , brains as well . Summer Glau does not star in this movie , however . T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed . Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay !",m,1

"As action films go there is action . That is fine for a big screen TV , but not worth the theater screen fare . Honestly , T1 & T2 were the best in the series and should have stopped there . All those that followed are just confused , inconsistent messes . Yep , the action is there but plot , story line , dialog , and acting are . . . well . . . never fluid . This film with McG and Bale prove it . If you want action it is here , if you are looking for rebirth of the franchise and substance . . . no it is not here .",m,0
"Buy or rent ? Buy or rent ? What to do . . . what to do ? Well , here 's a word of advice : If you 're like me and you want to see the Director 's Cut the R version versus the Theatrical PG-13 version , buy this . Because I first rented it from Netflix , but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that 's PG-13 . I found this especially odd because I ca n't find a Blu Ray version for sale that 's PG-13 . So how and why is it that Netflix 's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13 ? Am I sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . There is no mention of Director 's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself . The disc did indeed say Blu Ray . And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA . But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director 's Cut extra 's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo 's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product . Regardless of whether you get the Director 's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version , you 're in for an average movie viewing experience at best . I was certainly entertained . I love the Terminator movies . . . especially T1 and T2 . I know a lot folks hated T3 ; I for one did not hate T3 . T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2 , but it was n't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound . No , I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average . . . in their own unique ways . And I 'll tell ya , it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie ? Have you heard that ? Oh my God , what a chump . Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale ; Worthington 's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year 's remake of < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B00005JKO7 '' > Clash of the Titans < a > . Got ta give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too ; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn the guy who played Reese in the original < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000F9RB9Y '' > Terminator < a > . But the story in Salvation did n't come close to living up to what Terminator or < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001RIY4WE '' > Terminator 2 : < a > delivered . Salvation 's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations , and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations . How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director 's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series ? Maybe he did n't teeny-bop Salvation , but it was very weeknight CW networked up . Bottom line : Terminator Salvation is a rental , but if you rent it at least be sure that you 're getting the Director 's Cut . One way to be sure that you get the Director 's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart . Buy or rent ? Buy or rent ? What to do . . . what to do ?",m,0
"I thought this was a great Science Fiction film . Granted it was later surpassed by District 9 and Avatar , but this movie was the best one for the summer . It was n't without problems , but it had a terrific atmosphere to it , a lot of innovative shots and an exciting plot which moves along nicely . This is what I expected from this film , a sort of a prequel and a sequel that sets up the events of the apocalypse , of the Skynet fallout . What 's not to like here ? The cool characters ? the solid acting by Bale , Worthington , Kyle Reese , the Moon character . . the intense fighting scenes ? the feeling of the great sadness . . . similar to that of Battlestar Galactica Reimagined ?

"T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it 's layered with modern themes , awesome action , and inspired performances from Hamilton , Furlong , and Morton . Cameron is a jerk , but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore . Outside of that , Terminator : Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea . The effects are first class , there are some decent action sequences well choreographed but they ca n't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs . If you 're a fan , you 'll find yourself going , `` what ? `` and `` I knew it ! `` alternately through the film . But you 'll also say `` that was cool '' a few times , too .

I wish James Cameron had the means to buy his baby back and do this thing right . Screw Fox and WB . I still liked the movie but I 'm tired of the Pg-13 ratings and blue ray being forced upon me . I already spent my money on a 300 Dvd collection ! Im not building a blue ray collection . Is it better , yeah , but hollywood has made enough money off of me .

"T4 is a film that had so much potential but sadly barely fails to deliver . I love the imagery of the film , the smoky , grimy dirtiness of everything , the decaying city vistas . The acting was actually good , not on the level of T2 but still well enough to keep the audience absorbed in the film . Sam Worthington in his American debut , even though he had already filmed `Avatar ' , steals the movie from Christian Bale . Salvation lacks something . We get see the T-600 models of the Terminators , but we do n't get to see them in full force , only three or four personal encounters and not a full on battle in the post nuclear wasteland . It 's not an actual war movie and that 's what Terminator fans wanted to see , full on early battles between humanity and Skynet that were hinted at in the first two films , but instead we only get commando raids that begin and end the movie with formulaic action sequences in between . We also do n't see John Conner lead . He 's either being bossed around by command or working with a small number . It 's Marcus who 's the real star and a far more interesting story . A criminal gets the needle in ought three suddenly wakes up fifteen years later in the middle of a destroyed laboratory and must figure out what the hell is going on and becomes horribly freaked out when he discovers that he 's actually just a heart and a brain inside a synthetic body .",m,0
"Like many Terminator fans , I was highly skeptical of this film 's genuineness . After all , when films change hands , many times the real flow gets lost in the other director 's point of view or a prematurely finished film . `` Salvation '' surprisingly does n't stray too far from what I would call the genuineness of the storyline . A few spots make you cringe a bit because the lines `` come with me if you want to live '' and `` there 's no fate by what we make '' are regurgitated in the film . However even though the first half was hard to get into , by the time the movie is 3 4 done , you are sucked in completely . This is not anything like the other Terminator movies , as it is based in the present , not in the past . . . and it 's more of a sci-fi war film than a story-based sci-fi thriller . The appearance of the Arnold-looking T-800 towards the end nails it down . The first T-800 appears , and it immediately hones in on John Connor . It is indestructable and incredibly merciless . A wonderful foreshadowing of the human-cyborg terminators . Details are well-scripted , even to the very detail of John Connor 's face getting scarred by the Terminator 's nails compare his scars in Terminator 2 at the beginning , when Commander John Connor is lowering his binoculars . The rescue of young Kyle Reese was wonderful , but the introduction of Kyle made him look like a street rat who steals things and vandalizes . All with his little black kid side kick . I would have appreciated a little more depth , a way to get to know the characters better so you can really connect . This is obviously missing when compared to the work of Cameron in the first two installments . Story-wise this film is incredible . Compared to the other Terminator films however I was expecting more . It always seems that it would be the new director 's point of view on how it really should be . I think the new director did a good job on this film . Kudos .",m,1
"Great movie , everything I expected for a continuation of the Terminator story , and then some . Very well done . Highly entertaining . The ONLY flaw is when they introduced Arnold S 's terminator model T101 ? . . . it was clearly computer generated and looked a little fake , but not too bad . Humans ARE hard to do in CG , so . . . That aside , this was a GREAT movie .",m,1
"This is a great addition to the Terminator series . Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California Los Angeles , San Francisco , places in between But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design . You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron did n't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day . T-1s , T-600s , T-700s , T-800s , Hunter Killers , Moto-Terminators , The Harvester , you name it . . . this movie has it . Now actorwise , Christian Bale The Dark Knight as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines , very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father , Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin Star Trek . Then . . . finally . . . Sam Worthington Avatar as Marcus Wright . . . oh my god . . . I tell you , if Sam Worthington did n't play this role I do n't know who would have . In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother , he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments . He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot , Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood Street Fighter and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times . You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated . This talented aussie actor really did a break out role in this film and is my personal favorite character . This film has non stop action , amazing actors , and great effects to make this personally one of the best Terminator films yet .",m,1
"I was reading some bad reviews about this movie , and I was a bit amazed . The CGI to me it was pretty good , at least I liked it better than the Terminator 3 CGI . . . Some people said it had many plotholes but I really did n't see them , we did n't know much about the story about Kyle and John becoming a leader , etc . . . Some of the reviews I read were also complaining for things they either did n't understand or did n't pay enought attention , or simply did n't know some things and just criticized for the sake of it . One HUGE mistake that I notice constantly that people make , is when they go to see a movie with a preovious expectation . . . If you go to see a movie thinking it 's going to be awesome or at least thinking it might be similar to `` something '' you 're probably gon na exit the theater dissapointed . . . As how it happens if you do n't know what to expect of a movie and you end up liking it sometimes you go see a movie thinking it will suck and when you finish it , you keep thinking the same , but that 's just the mistake of going to see that movie with a fixed expectation of failure Overall I liked the movie , the acting was n't anything amazing , but it was enough for this movie , and the story of Marcus I found it to be interesting and well adapted into the idea of the movie . Finally , I think that people who went to see this movie and did n't like it is because they were expecting another terminator , like the previous ones , or simply was expecting to be dissapointed and got what they hoped for , but still it 's a good story , maybe not a huge story , but an important part of the mythology IMO , it added new things to our knowledge , it confirmed others and just played with information we already knew just for the viwer 's pleasure . . .",m,1
loved this movie . this is one of those that 'll stay in my collection . cant wait for the next one .,m,1
"I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE RECIEVED THE SHORT END OF THE STICK , ITS MY FAVORITE TERMINATOR MOVIE . GREAT ACTING , ANTON YELCHIN , BRICE DALLAS HOWARD , MOON BLOODGOOD , CHRISTIAN BALE , SAM WORTHINGTON , GREAT ACTORS , , STORY & MCG DID AN AWESOME JOB . I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE ANOTHER . . . BUT MOST LIKELY NOT IT TOOK OVER 2 YRS TO COME OUT . SOMETIMES PEOPLE CANT GET OVER THE ORGINAL , I HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS MOVIE & RELISE JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS",f,1
"Actually , I 've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas . The ONLY place I found it Director 's Cut , Digital Copy was on Amazon .",f,1
"I found this movie to be very good , especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future . Bale , Yelchin , and Worthington give excellent performances . The action and special effects are great . The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film . Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately , but they forget that it has always been Skynet 's goal to kill Connor , not Reese , and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor 's father .",m,1
"This DVD is heavy on the special effects and light on the plot . Having seen all of the terminator movies , there has been a downward spiral since `` The Governator '' left the scene . Given the economic state of California , who knows , maybe he will `` be back '' as promised . On the other hand , Terminator the TV Series is excellent . Much better than the movies . The scripts are written very well with a great deal of novel ideas worked into the plot that are technologically sound . For example , the notion that sophisticated traffic management systems could be the precursor to the terminator 's nervous system was an inspired parallel . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001AQO43M '' > Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season < a > < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001AQR3J4 '' > Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season [ Blu-ray < a > ] The writers of the TV series have clearly done their homework as well as providing creative plot lines that hold the viewer 's attention any loyalty . The movie scripts are , for the most part hack jobs with Terminator Salvation serving as an arch-typical illustration . The whizzbang is fine , but there needs to be a bit more substance behind the plot .",m,0
"For Terminator Fans , of which I am one , this was an entertaining movie . It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening . It was the best of the recent man vs . machine genre movies . There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things .",m,0
"I was disappointed in this sequel , tho the special effects and most action was terrific . The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me . The ending was predictable early on , and was a clone of `` I Robot . `` The film 's monotone coloration was depressing , and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls huh ? and skeletal teeth they eat hot dogs ? The attempt to weave in Arnold S . at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick Terminator 2 felt disjointed and like an afterthot . Save your money .",m,0
"Well , the movie was fun and it was great to see Arnold , well kinda , back as the character that started it all . The movie is well worth watching and the picture is awsome . The so called director 's cut , leaves alot to be desired . The rating is changed to an `` R '' because of 3 minutes that are lame and could have been more . We see a all to brief view of Williams breast , and , I do mean brief and from the side . This does NOT improve the movie or add anything to the plot . I am happy that this version came with the set , if , I bought this version for the extra scene it would have been a big let down . I hope that a version with more extra scenes is released soon .",m,1
"This was one of the best terminator movie yet , evryone play their part and it was just a sit down and enjoy yorself type moive , I Recommend this movie to anyone that like action pack and hold on to the edge of your set movie .",f,1
"I keep seeing a lot of people calling the 3rd movie `` campy '' , and the 2nd `` the best '' . I think these are just everyday movie goers saying things like that . Fans of the series who like action will like T2 the best , but fans more into horror say the 1st will never be beaten . Terminator : Salvation will be closer to the first film than the other two . I like this movie more than the 2nd and 3rd . The 2nd has the James Cameron aura around it that has everyone charmed . And even though the 3rd was filled with action and `` over the top '' machine on machine battles , it comes in 4th . I still wake up from nightmares of a blown in half Terminator crawling after me where ever I am , so the first is 1st on my list . Terminator : Salvation is full of the things that will only make my nightmares worse . James Cameron zombies are giving this movie low ratings to keep it down . If you are more of a fan of the First Terminator , this one might make you feel good .",m,1
"I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation , and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out , it has all the future scenes from Terminator , T2 , and T3 . This was a radical movie . I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created . I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights . it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold 's face , as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies . it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright , but did not shoot at him , because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg . it did n't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie , because I got a good thrill out of it none the less .",m,1
"As expected , the special effects were , well , special . Unfortunately , after the special effects , there apparently was not enough money left to pay for a 14 year-old to point out the glaring errors in the script - my favorite was when the 6 story-tall robot that shook the earth when it walked and was accompanied by a jet plane , snuck up on the people in the desert quick-trip . The script also failed to close the loop and send Kyle back to save Sarah . The basic problem is that somebody other than James Cameron was allowed to direct the sequel Terminator movies . The second one was not terrible , but the T3 and Salvation were way off from what they could have been .",m,0
"This movie never really never got the credit it deserved at the box office . This is a really good action flick . My husband said it was the best movie he 'd seen in a long time and we watch a lot of movies . It 's got non-stop edge-of-your-seat action , and I thought Christian Bale was GREAT as John Connor . Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this , too . If you read the reviews , you 'll see what 's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people do n't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version , but not the regular dvd version . This movie gets five stars from me .",m,1
many of the old fan hates this movie . I am young fan and like the war of future . terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan . There so much to take advantage of . If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling . The moives does have it flaws like john Conner 's wound at the end . Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie .,m,1
"I saw this movie with my son , and it is nothing like the other movies but make a little bit of sense to me but I think it could have been a hell of alot better with fighting sequence and special effets . I understand why sam worthington is a terminator because of my states gov . not being able to film in it but yet they use the cg versiion of him , that was cool . on the other hand I think they should bring worthingtons caracter back for the next movie and give him more of a role as well as other cast members . and find someone other than christan bale . . . . .",m,1
"Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie . . . The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive . They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch . They lacked a passionate or fiery edge yes even in their vocies as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC ? Oh wait , Linda Hamilton 's voice was used . . . and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them . John Connor did nothing for this story , his parts could have been all in the background and it would n't of impacted the storyline in any way . Continuity and Common sense were ignored : Example 1 : The T-600 - Kyle Reese said they were covered in rubber skin , which made them easier to spot up close . Synthetic skin , hair , nails etc . being the last comestic improvements on the Terminator robots - turning them into cyborgs . McG the director probably thought he said they were easy to spot because they were 8 or 9 feet tall and had a minigun on one arm . The rubber skin on the movie T-600s was not a disguise at all . It was some rubber sheets draped over their head . I do n't honestly believe many pro-wrestlers are EVEN close to being that big or ugly so unless Skynet wanted to infiltrate a Wrestling Federation Organization it was doing things wrong in Terminator : Salvation . Example 2 : The giant machine which scoops up people from buildings like a fat man grabbing pop-corn . . . How the hell does something that large sneak up on paranoid people in the future ? Especially small communes in the middle of nowhere ? Was it wearing a rubber sheet with wrestling tights on ? It has been reported that when the director McG was asked about this film and how it 's not up to any kind of standards that he replied with `` it 's just a damn dumb summer action , terminator movie , it 's not supposed to be cerebral , it 's a pop-corn fantasy flick '' . No wonder Bill Murray punched him out once . If you hated T3 remember this about TS : The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris . From Wikipedia : Based on 250 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , critical reaction for Terminator Salvation tended toward negativity with an overall 32 % approval rating . Among Rotten Tomatoes ' Top Critics , which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers , websites , television and radio programs , the film holds an overall approval rating of 29 percent . By comparison , Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 52 , based on 35 reviews . At all three websites , the film ranked lowest among the Terminator franchise films .",m,0
"If you love the Terminator franchise . . . well , you 'd HAVE to love it to endure this mess . The first two flicks were awesome , of course . The third ? Not so much . T4 ? The downward spiral continues . Huge budget , talented actors and great story material are all majestically pissed away . The Charlie 's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares ? I did n't and that was the problem . Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes . Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences . Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood sp ? get to have a romance and why do we need this or care ? All of these people are extremely talented and again , the effects ? More or less spectacular . But I found myself apathetic . In the earlier films you found a stake in the characters and cared . With T4 I felt like I was watching a play by Max Fisher . Well done but just not the real deal .",m,0
"It 's difficult these days to please a sophisticated world audience . We 've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us , inspire us , make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained . Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that . IMHO , it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced . The acting is outstanding , the characters are endearing , compelling and artfully developed . Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor . Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence . Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction . The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry Star together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge . The special effects were first rate , along with the script , sound and pace of the movie . If you love sci-fi , you 're going to love this movie .",m,1
"Nothing new happens in this movie . It has plenty of action , mostly in the form of explosions , but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward . The viewer goes out where he came in . Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer 's intelligence with lazy plot devices . For example , there are scenes involving the movement of massive , clanking machines , yet characters are n't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them . Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline , or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine . The movie is riddled with such devices . They play out , one after another , for about two hours . Nothing else happens . We learn nothing new . My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series .",m,0
while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically . the action is n't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top . you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you do n't assuming you 've seen the first 3 previously,m,1
I will be the 1st to say when I saw this in theaters I left with alot of questions . But with the maximum movie mode where McG pops up every now and then and explains things and tells you the thought process for alot of scenes I finally understand how this one fits the other 3 . Still I think only the true die hard fans of the Terminator movies will appreciate this movie .,m,1
"This movie is so massively wrong-headed , and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film , that I can only assume it 's deliberate . I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron 's 1984 classic . What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness ? Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018 , John Connor Christian Bale struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance . Marcus Wright Sam Worthington , executed by the state fifteen years earlier , awakes not one day older , already in the thick of fighting . But in a matter of hours , Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need : the current location of young Kyle Reese Anton Yelchin . The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us . Because many of us distrust ordinary technology , Cameron 's 1984 film is justly considered a classic . This film , by contrast , seems written as a showcase for the special effects . There is not one moment of tension , not one revealing human moment , not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth . This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces , fight sequences , and explosions . Everything is tightly so choreographed , I never get the feeling anything has really happened . If you doubt what I mean , I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold , head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts , tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee . Yeah , the whole movie is like that . Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other , better sci-fi movies . You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all . Beer for Star Wars , wine for The Matrix , liquor for Spielberg 's War of the Worlds . Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels . I saw not one original set piece , line of dialog , or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster . Cameron 's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever . The second film was good . The third was adequate . This one is awful . I do n't throw negative superlatives around , because they get abused , but this is the worst film I 've seen in at least three years . I will watch no more Terminator films . I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way .",m,0
"I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it . Unlike all the other films , it lacks a story , or even characters you care about . Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about . But the truly talentless MTV director McG and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes . One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike , it 's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie , especially since it is mostly shot in dark , grimy locales . Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart . Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about . Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous . So many holes there it 's hard to know where to begin . So here 's the deal . You like lots of explosions and fights -- go for it . Lots of that here . You want a movie that makes sense or has any sort of connection to the original Terminator movies , forget it .",m,0
Can someone tell me what this movie was about ? The plot if there WAS one was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again and have done in spite of Edward Furlong 's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor . There 's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED . One HUGE disappointment . Sorry - I WO N'T `` be back '' if this is the best they can do ! !,m,0
I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator `` Arnold Schwarzenegger . `` A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you have n't seen it .,m,1

"I am a huge fan of the Terminator series . The second movie being my personal favorite and also just my favorite movie of all time . 'Nuff said . That being said , it 's hard for me to watch a Terminator and be . . . impartial I guess you could say cuz I love this series so damn much . That first Terminator movie was incredible and you were really hoping to see more of the incredible story unfold . After Judgment Day , I would always wonder what the hell happened to the movies ? ! At the very least , there were plenty of Terminator comics you could follow . I never actually read them cuz I was just a kid and had no idea of there existence until more recently . . . I 've gotten side tracked . . . Uhhh I read Robocop vs Terminator though . That was awesome . OK back on track : Flash forward some 12 years I see a commercial for another Terminator movie . Well its about damn time . I saw it , thought it was dope few things coulda been done differently but I did n't care . The franchise had finally been revived . So all that side tracking and talking about movies and comics that have nothing to do with the rating of this movie brings me to . . . this movie . Terminator Salvation . As I was walking out of the theater , I thought it was an incredible movie and they did absolutely no wrong with it . We 're finally seeing what we 've been waiting to see since Kyle Reese talked about the future way back in the first movie . Now I got ta step back and attempt to impartiality . This is gon na be tough . . . OK visually ; stunning . Bale as John Connor ; I 've heard it before and I agree . His stoic acting needed to go somewhere . Nothing against him as an actor cuz I enjoy the stuff he 's done but I do n't feel like he portrayed John Connor the way he should have . Also , its got ta be rough hiding that accent and trying to act a certain way so I 'll just chalk it up to that . Ok , the story ; Yeah , it was pretty weak . Spoilers Exactly what I mean by that is that the machines knowing of Kyle Reese 's existence and even capturing him and not offing him that very second did n't make any sense . That would have been the end of everything right there . I have no beef with Marcus ' character either . Considering all the changes that happened in the past , it makes sense for something new to emerge in this altered future . It 's also cool cuz you have this guy who lost his humanity to Skynet and wants to take names because of it . I think that about covers it . Giving this movie 3 stars makes me feel dirty though . If it were possible to give it 3 and a half I would",m,0
This was a gift for my son-in-law forChristmas and I got it for a superprice because I pre-ordered it onAmazon as a gift . Thank you Amazon,f,1
"I 've watched this movie 3 times now and I must say I do enjoy the action part of the movie , that being said some of the script could have been much better , some of the lines delivered are just ridiculous . for example the character Marcus delivers a line `` So that 's what death taste 's like '' after kissing the Doctor in the beginning of the movie was very corny . Also there are some major issues when Marcus meets Kyle Reese , didnt Kyle find it odd that Marcus wasnt aware of why he didnt know about `` Judgement Day '' he never questions that ? The movie was drivin more for action than character development . . so if you keep that in mind you can still enjoy the movie . The DVD quality is as follows : Picture is very good even in most of the darker scenes , and the digital grading used to make most of the movie look greyish is well done . The sound dept for the Dolby Digital 5 . 1 Mix is excellent , great use of surrounds and Subwoofer which should be expected with an Action movie . In closing I hope the next Terminator movie has some better lines and character development , I enjoyed the Marcus character , but felt it could have been better . So leave your brain on off and just watch the movie and enjoy",m,0

"I guess I really dont get why so many ppl trash this movie , sure it 's not perfect how many are ? , but it is a great action movie in my opinion and I was entertained by it . I like many of you am also a fan of the terminator series and yes I know T2 rocked and was the best . Is it b c Arnold is no longer there , except in the cgi form which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out or perhaps b c James Cameron did n't direct it ? Personally I judge it on its own accord new actors new director rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies . I liked Mr . Bale as Connor , he did a pretty good job . I liked the story line w Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet . The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern futuristic feel to it which is cool . Although I wish the movie was longer , 1 hr 45 minutes approx . just seems too short in my opinion , it would 've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development . I dont like the clean PG-13 rating . I would like it to be more violent , bloody , gory , gritty , etc . staying true to a real war situation . Overall , I 'm glad they made this movie , it gives the series new legs , and I look forward to more .",m,1
"Christan Bale gives a outstanding genuine heart felt performance as John Connor . I also enjoyed the fact that they had a half human half terminator in this film . The coolest thing besides that is a CGI cameo by Arnold Swartzeneger in the final act of the movie . The special effects were sweet as well as the stunts and robotics . Anton Yelchin was really good as teenage Kyle Reese . This was a genuine portrayal of the future war against machines . The picture is okay for what picture the format can produce . The other thing that bothered me was the fact that this dvd version does not include the `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie . I would also like to point out that the dvd has absolutely no extras . The Blu-ray version of the movie not only includes the `` Director 's cut '' but other extras that talk about how they did stunts and effects for the movie . The `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie is 3 minutes longer and includes a nude scene in the rain of Moon Bloodgood , more blood in the scene where men attempt to rape her , and a tension building scene between Christian Bale and Michael Ironside in which `` General Ashdown '' puts a gun to John Connor 's head . I prefered the `` Director 's Cut '' version of the movie because it lent more to the story emotionally and visually . Also to those who think there is no difference between `` Blu-ray '' and `` Dvd '' you need to get some glasses morons . It offers 6x the resolution that `` Dvd '' produces , and you get a much more crisper detailed picture . The difference is mind blowing considering it is a increase in resolution of `` 720x480i '' to `` 1920x1080p . `` You would have to be an idiot to not consider buying a `` Blu-ray '' player if you own a `` HDTV '' . DVD is fine if you have a tube tv but it is so blury and nasty on a `` HDTV . `` The Bottom line is Terminator Salvation is better on Bluray . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001FB55HQ '' > Terminator Salvation Widescreen Edition < a >",m,0

"When I think of the `` Terminator '' film franchise , two things immediately come to mind : an iconic leading actor like Arnold Schwarzenegger who can carry the film , and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up . This film , by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline , ensures a successful fourth installment . Basically , in `` Terminator Salvation '' , we finally get a glimpse into the future , where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor Bale are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time . While the war rages on , Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his and mankind 's entire existence . Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon . . . a `` terminator '' who thinks he is a human , throwing Connor and his gang for a loop . Though not a classic film in any sense of the word , I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at . . . the human resistance against Skynet . The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project , and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show , and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things : preview the `` terminators '' of the future , and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor . Plus , I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise , such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale 's own twist on the iconic `` I 'll be back '' line . Thus , although I feel that this film could have been much more epic , it was , as a fan of the Terminator franchise , entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end . It also sets the stage for a possible sequel , which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next `` Batman Begins '' , or instead turn into `` Superman Returns '' .",m,1
"great graphics , good sci fi , our family of 5 , 4 of which are male love the terminator movies .",f,1
"This movie is nowhere near bad as people say it is . It is n't even near bad period ! Now some may have had different expectations going into it of what it would be , but that 's their own fault . The movie is awesome .",m,1
"I barely remember the Terminator movies , so the impact was less harmfull onwatching terminator salvation . I was'nt really looking for a continuation of thefranchise , i just wanted to be entertained . And that 's what this movie does . I found the movie had great effects , good sound and some great robots . Thecharacters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent . I find itsoo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end . . . but a must for the movie . A keeper . . . good to watch multiple times .",m,1
"great pic that fills the gap , and like the other films has the terminator as the savior",m,1
"While this is no T2 the best in the franchise , in my opinion , Salvation is at least better than T3 which was a ham-fest . This provides a different view on the Terminator series in the sense that it does take place in 2018 . I went in to this movie with little or no expectations because of the bad reviews and came out pleasantly surprised . It 's a decent film . I would and have watch it more than once . What this says for my intelligence is questionable as it seems to be made with someone with a low IQ but sometimes these mindless-fun popcorn movies end up being the best guilty pleasures .",m,1
"It 's saving grace is that it did have a plot and it did sync up pretty well with the other 3 Terminator movies , but it could have been so much better , especially with an actor like Christian Bale staring in it . I 've really enjoyed all of his movies and tried so hard to like this one as well . It was filled with CGI , most of it fair to bad as well as goofy things that no human could ever survival , like a helocast from a pretty decent altitude at a high rate of speed that John Conner performed and did n't even get wet in the process . The plot was overcast by almost non-stop action in an apparent attempt to hide it , which is a real shame , as the plot is a noble one . The ending was unsurprising as well . Of course we all know that John Conner has to survive or the other movies in the franchise would n't make sense , but there was only one surprise to the whole thing and that card should have been played closer to the end so that boredom would n't set in before it thankfully came to an end .",m,0
The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie . I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen . That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action . I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action . The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox ' that brings the `John Conner ' guy into existence . How he sent his father back to his mom . And if he does n't do this then he will not `be ' . Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing . I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion . Just do n't expect any action . It 's not a `fun ' kill em ' all kind of film ; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip .,m,0
"Despite some strong acting , this is n't much of a movie . The next day I could n't remember how it ended . But that 's not what I want to focus on . I want to talk about the DVD , not the movie itself . This pertains to the single-disk widescreen regular DVD edition . There are only two choices you have on the main menu : `` Play Movie '' and `` Languages . `` No special features . No scene selections . Scene selection is a standard function of every DVD I have seen in the last decade . How could it not be included on this disk ? ? Even worse is the inescapable previews and ads . This is one of the nastiest tricks studios can put on a DVD . It is an insult . Movie previews and ads for video games and graphic novels start playing when you insert the disk . You can not escape them . Press the menu button and you will see something like `` This action prohibited in this disk . `` Try to jump through them quickly with the Chapter button and you will see the same thing . You ca n't get away from them until they 're finished . The ONLY thing you can do is go Fast Forward . You still ca n't get rid of them , you still have to see them , but at least it 's a little faster . Years from now if you want to watch this movie on this DVD , you will still have to sit through trailers for movies and products that are then old and probably forgotten . You want to kick the studio exec who thought this would be a good marketing tool . We should boycott the purchase of this DVD to protest the sleazy marketing techniques of the studio .",m,0
"Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series the first one and having seen the sequels ; I set my expectation levels very low for this one ; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream . I have to say . . . I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be . I do n't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I 've ever seen in any movie . While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy , I would have to agree only with the editing . The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character . If you know your T- Series movies . . you know what I am talking about . Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment , Arnold coming back sort of as the original terminator which looked so real . They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984 . Even the scar on John Connor 's face which is in a future scene on T2 was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator . Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch . I have to compliment the actors as well . I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese . Although , I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie 's story line . This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie . I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie , even though it 's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating . I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series .",m,1
"The Good : Special effects are in general excellent . Sound design is great if you have a home theatre set-up . I liked the performances of Sam Worthington 's and Anton Yelchin and there were a couple of nice little homage 's to the first two films - the `` come with me if you want to live '' line and the nod to Guns and Roses . The Bad : Christian Bale - now I know his performance has split the Amazon critics , for me it did n't really work . I found his performance very wooden and he exhibits none of the charisma that I would expect a leader of a resistance movement to have . The Plot - in a nutshell there 's too many holes . We never really find out what motivates the Sam Worthington character . He emerges from the ground and starts walking - he tells Kyle Reese that he 's heading north - for what ? - it 's never explained . And why for example does Skynet need to lure John Connor to its base - surely , if it just killed Kyle Reese then Connor would not exist anymore -the film is a bit sketchy on the whole time travel , cause and effect thing anyway . And given that Skynet is using Reese to lure Conor , the whole premise behind Sam Worthingtons character becomes a bit redundant . I know that at its heart it 's just a big dumb action movie but I like my dumb action movies make some kind of sense - at least in the context of their own universe . Oh , and John Connor 's wife must be one of the most underwritten characters I 've ever seen - she literally adds nothing to the movie . In summary , it 's not a bad movie - it 's certainly better than T3 , but it really does n't stand up to comparison with the first two movies in the franchise .",m,0
"Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation , one of which is much more interesting than the other . Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements , but a later writing team could n't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense . The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood , as well as Yelchin , and is the more interesting of the two . The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film , and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we have n't before . The second movie stars Christian Bale , and is not nearly as interesting . In many ways , John Connor is essentially along for the ride . I do n't understand this , given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance , and a charismatic leader ; you 'd think he 'd be the focus of the movie . Bale 's Connor is bland and unapproachable , through no fault of Bale ; the script gives him very little to work with . On the bright side , there is n't much here that 's going to tick you off if you 're a fan of the Terminator movies , unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV . On the down side , after it 's over , my reaction was `` huh , so that was it , `` instead of , `` that was really cool . `` When a movie with killer robots , time travel , Helena Bonham Carter , a nuclear war , and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response , it has failed in its mission . This is fine as a rental , but I would n't add this to my permanent collection .",m,0
"Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines . John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form . Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams , `` Noooooo ! `` Lots of fighting . Stuff blows up . Machines buzz . Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day . Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there 's no prize for the winner . It 's just two hours of stuff grinding together .",m,0
"I 'll start out by saying that I love The Terminator franchise , concepts , and basically the universe of ideas that Cameron spawned within his mind a long time ago . However , I must say that there were only two things that stopped this review from getting one star rather than two . One being that Christian Bale was in this movie , as he is one of my favorite actors , however is performance here was lacking . The second would be the special effects which were very well done . The rest of the movie though basically sucks , as did T3 . The rest of the cast sucks , even B . D . Howard , and they give a third rate performance . And the plot ? Do n't get me started . Where is the continuity here ? Fox 's `` The Sarah Connors Chronicles '' keeps continuity more in line , stemming from T2 . T3 sucked so bad that it does n't even count . Thank God for special effects and Bale , or this film could have been T3 part two . We can always think . . . what could have been . Peace and Love , Jake",m,0
Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited ! Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly !,f,1
"I have really liked the the first three movies , even the goofy third . This one was difficult to follow . The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects . However , the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting . It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese , they were n't . Not really . Then , we have the end . I felt it was straining for some deep moral ethical statement , but just struck me as empty , loose and amateurish . I think it 's really time to Terminate this series :",m,0
"John Connor could not prevent Judgment Day from happening ; he could only delay it . Now the war has arrived , and John Christian Bale , along with his wife Bryce Dallas Howard and any other surviving humans they run across are part of the Resistance , a group fighting for survival against the machines . Marcus Sam Worthington is part man , part machine , a rejuvenated murderer who was put to death before Judgment Day . The machines created him to combat the Resistance , but his human soul makes him loyal to that side of himself . After sneaking into a base , John Connor orders him to be destroyed , but an amorous female Moon Bloodgood helps him escape . Marcus barters with John ; he will infiltrate Skynet to save Kyle Reese Anton Yelchin , John 's father . As a stand-alone movie , Terminator Salvation is a mediocre action movie which follows a formula set up by others of the genre . It has exciting moments , its predictable moments , and boring stretches . However , as a member of the Terminator series , it is incredibly disappointing , and has such a different mood , it stands out like a wrong note . Somehow the post-apocalyptic world does not seem as scary and desolate as it did in Reese 's flashbacks in T1 . There is too much daylight in this movie , and the Resistance has too many resources . Furthermore , these actors ' renditions of famous lines from the previous films come out cheesy and cheap , like the film makers just threw them in to keep fans happy . There are also several continuity problems . How does Alice in Chains begin playing in the Jeep after Marcus hot wires it ? I find it hard to believe that a CD , let along a car , survived the nuclear explosions , but lets just assume they did . How , then , does Guns and Roses play over the radio when there is n't a radio station around to broadcast it ? Also , how did Sarah Connor 's tapes survive Judgment Day ? I found it annoying too that they 've been re-recorded , although audio obviously exists of them from previous films . I find it rather annoying that the cast changes with each film ; maybe the film makers should take a hint when all of their stars refuse to reprise their roles . The characters seem very shallow in comparison to the previous films . We have spent years getting to know them , John Connor particularly , and suddenly he 's completely different , a hardened shell of who he used to be . Bale plays the part like he never saw the other movies in the series , which is made all the more obnoxious because he is a celebrated `` Method '' actor . His involvement seems is a gross miscasting . The most fascinating character is Reese , who is a bit of a mystery anyway , but if a sequel is made and I hope one is n't , let 's hope Reese is the focus .",f,0
"One of the best movies to come out of 2009 , Terminator Salvation was exactly what the franchise needed to reinvigorate itself . 2003 's Terminator 3 did for this franchise what the Maginot Line did for France in WWII : Nothing . In fact , I 'd hazard to guess the Maginot Line was at least a passive failure while Terminator 3 fell more along the lines of `` Is there any possible way I can remove my rectum through my mouth ? `` type of epic failure . Thankfully , Terminator Salvation rectifies this . While not as action packed as its three predecessors , we are finally introduced to John Connor , whose very existence has been the crux of the Terminator dogma . Exploring the initial structure of the human resistance , and its looming possibility of schism , truly gave one a sense of the scattered and desolate nature of humanity . It also showcases a stage in the ever-changing evolution of Skynet and its slow , rumbling path towards human extinction . Skynet is n't everywhere yet and the resistance , while holding out , still lacks the momentum , and personnel , to truly strike any critical blows against its AI antagonist . This sets up a very well-written story and poses the question `` What truly makes us human ? `` The Blu-Ray transfer enhances the visual and audio experience and makes this installment a new and worthy torchbearer for the franchise . I would highly recommend this title to anyone .",m,1
What a great film ! Blu ray is awesome ! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra 's that give a great couple hours enjoyment .,m,1
"The movie gets one star only because I ca n't give it less . Transformers was Shakespeare in terms of writing compared to this crap . Was this written and edited by a 12 year old ? Or is this the mean mentality they think viewers have ? The previous Ts were enjoyable movies because they did n't expect a lot of you and you did n't expect a lot from them and they did not insult your intelligence -- they kept it simple . If you have n't figured it out in the first 10 minutes , the moment you see Michael Ironside you should have a clear idea of what you are in for . This movie sucks , simple as that . The writing is beyond poor , I am shocked this has been positively reviewed at all . Did people see a different movie than I did ? In this movie : everyone yells ; people do the stupidest things that make ZERO sense just to propel an action sequence or some ludicrous plot device ; every cliche you could ever groan about is crammed in at every conceivable opportunity ; the big monster robots come with a soundtrack from War of the Worlds -- complete with people collection cages yawn ; strangers will immediately give up precious food if you have a cute kid with you who conveniently carries a tummy pack overflowing with little 3M bandaids to put on the strangers little scratch so we feel their `` bond '' ; oh , and if said stranger comes up to you and takes your gun but wo n't tell you anything about them , by all means you should immediately take them to get a vehicle because they are so easily attainable , oh and if you by chance happen to turn on the radio ? well the first song that will come on will be something 'special ' to him ; and , finally do n't forget to ask him to be your leader , so what you have had no other dialogue between you and you do n't know anything about him and you live in treacherous times . . . I kept leaning over and asking : is this really this dumb ? Yes , it really was that dumb . Waste .",f,0
"I'v enjoyed all 4 films . The only thing I notice missing from Salavation was the pacing was off . The first 3 films yes , even the 3rd kept up that relentless , stalking , edge of your seat type pacing that the 4th film just lacked . In terms of quality of production , acting , effects , it 's top notch . It just does n't flow as well as the earlier films . So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films . Does n't mean I did n't enjoy it or thought it was bad . . . . . . . just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films . Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-RayI 'm looking forward to the next film . Bring it on !",m,0
"Boy , this got hammered by most critics . But I do n't know what the problem was - I know it 's pretty grim from start of finish , and it does n't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks . But I thought this was really well done , and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job , the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie , and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout . Besides , how can you not love a movie who 's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood REAL name , not her character ! I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale 's on-set rant ; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie , it 's pretty darn good !",m,1
The digital copy included in the set expired in April 2010 . I just purchased it for the holidays . I would not have purchased this set if I had known . Now that it 's open it ca n't be returned .,f,0
THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT . CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR .,m,1
My family thought that this DVD was in a very good condition . Enjoyed it very much,f,1
"This is a better than average action film , but compared to earlier 3 , it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate , heroism , and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions , the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected , and Conor is , well , just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls , etc . Still , it is fun and the images are quite good at times . The acting is very strong with Bale , Yelchin , and Worthington . Oddly , Conor 's wife , who Danes so superlatively acted in T3 , is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done . Interestingly , I bought this as blu-ray , and I ca n't say that the picture , with the exception of a few images , is more than marginally better . There is no unmistakable , quantum improvement over dvds . REcommended . It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series . I 'd give this 3 . 5 stars .",m,0
"`` Terminator : Salvation '' is a worthy addition to the franchise , featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects , an engaging storyline , and strong performances . Speaking of the latter , Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man , ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future . Worthington balances `` butt-kicking '' with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale 's `` John Conner . `` `` Star Trek 's '' Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese , managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely `` overplayed '' in the Trek film . Welcome `` appearances '' are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way .",m,1
"I watched this movie , expecting a better storyline . There was less story and more special effects though . To me a movie is always a let down when that happens . I wo n't spoil it for you by telling you anything specifically in the movie . I will say that you can watch this without seeing any of the other terminator movies or The Sarah Connor Chronicles series and you will be able to follow with no problem . All in all I gave it 3 stars . Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie , as I have recently injured my back , and been laid up for over a week . Anyway , the movie is a great form of escapism , the action is almost non-stop as is the case with most terminator movies . I just wish there had been more to the storyline . It felt too gappy . Rod",m,0
"Great movie , great price . I really like the movie , I went to see it in theatres and then bought this one . The video quality is amazing and the movie is awesome . No regrets .",m,1
Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor ? I would have prefered a no name actor to play John Conner . The first time watching the movie I almost expected him to say I am Batman and throw a batarang or something . but other than this it is a great flick and follows well with the terminator line .,m,1
"Way to many people are trashing this movie for no good reason . This is a fine addition to the Terminator storyline . Set in the future after `` Judgment Day '' it follows John Connor leading the resistance . The movie is well written and well acted Worthington has serious potential and throws you the occassional curveball to keep you interested . The action is well done and cgi compliments it ! A must see for anyone who is a fan of the franchise . If this is your first exposure to it , you will find yourself looking for the other three movies a . s . a . p . MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS : A beautiful print with some eye popping sequences . Demo Disc potential . FINAL VERDICT : A MUST OWN .",m,1
"BACKGROUNDBack in the 80s I was n't a fan of the first Terminator movie and actually I was n't fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies at all . Years later I gave a chance to T2 and I was blown away . I thought that the movie was awesome and that they rescued the story . But then years later T3 came out and I was very disappointed . Now with Terminator Salvation I have mixed feelings . The movie and plot is essentially good and entertaining , but now I 'm convinced that T2 was `` an anomaly that went strangely great '' . PLOTOk , this is a summer action packed movie , if you are looking for that , you will get it . Explosions , killer robots , lots of action , etc . As long as I remember T3 , this is a very different story . On this movie , the world is at war against the machines kind of the war described in the Matrix trilogy , so if you ever imagined a prequel to Matrix , this could have been the script . As any other sci-fi movie that needs to show that humans are losing the war , is set in desert locations . This adds certain texture to images and overall aspect of the film . Just to give you an idea of the looks of this movie , the first thing that comes to my mind is Mad Max , the latest is Resident Evil : Extinction and a lot of other movies in between . PERSONAL COMMENTI have never been a hardcore fan of Terminator series , but I found this movie really entertaining and enjoyable . Hardcore fans will always complain about anything , but if you just want to sit back and relax 2 hours , this is for you . CASTChristian Bale is playing John Connor while Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a cameo appearance . Sam Worthington is introduced as a new character that links humans with machines . I thing that is all you need to know . The performances are solid for a sci-fi action film . MUSICAgain the T2 drums appear . They still sound great . Generally speaking the score is good . CONCLUSIONThis is good movie within its genre , intended for action sci-fi followers . It 's not definitive in the series but it 's definitively better than T3 . You will end enjoying it if you just sit back and relax .",m,1
"I went to see this movie and actually liked it . I think it would have been a little better if they could have had Arnold in it someway beside the little computer generated version of him for a couple of seconds . As far as how McG is releasing this on DVD , I am not happy . Where is the 2 disc special edition for DVD ? I do n't have a Blu-Ray player , and I do n't plan on buying one anytime soon , but I like to get the special editions of movies on the DVD . Every other big movie this year has a 2 disc special edition on DVD , but not Terminator , WHY ? I was really looking forward to the extend version that McG had talked about , and in the beginning he did say he was making a special edition for DVD , but not when release time actually came around . I guess I will have to deal with regular movie .",m,1
"Not impressed . . . clearly the only motivation behind this movie was to make a buck off the popularity of the first three Terminator movies . . . by 15 minutes in I was waiting for it to be over . About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale John Connor . Seems all he did was scream the whole time . The twist w Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting , but not enough so to save the picture overall . There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching , but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown .",m,0
"The special effects are really good . Some of the story is good . But overall , it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators . The ending was corny .",m,0
"This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins . Confusing and disjointed , frequently frustratingly illogical , it comes out boring , even with allthe well-done CGI mayhem . Said mayhem is non-stop , becoming a mindless blur of disjointedhuman and robot body parts flying nowhere . After the first two in the series , this one is even more of a disappointment , fans should see this as a continuation of T3 ; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name . At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $ 9 . 99 . Small consolation .",m,0

"see it finished a few minutes ago , the action secuences are just great , the argument that connects this with the other three films is superb , the sarah connor picture , the records , Kyle Reese , and of course Arnold , Sam Worthington in deed is worth to watch as the human hybrid-terminator he rocks here much more than Avatar , however , hardly a heart transplant can take place in a tent , further that the surgery is performed by a veterinary ! ! ! . . . . mmmm talking nonsense . . . i give it 4 or 5 stars , nevertheless is a very good movie !",m,1
"The movie was great and all , but what happened to the extras Deleted Scenes , Bloopers , Gag Reel and other extras ? This was a bare bones release . If they are going to release a movie to DVD , they should have all the extras that the fans would like to have . What 's the deal on the digital copy ? Why should I have to log onto the Web to get my digital copy . I paid for a 2-Disc set , do I expect to have a DVD of the movie and a Digital Disc copy of the movie , not a coupon to download the digital copy . Let 's see that 's fraud in my opinion or disceptive practices . Wonder what the FCC would think about this ?",m,0
"Gads ! All the whining ! `` Terminator : Salvation '' did what it was supposed to do . ENTERTAIN ! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director 's cut , so the DVD did n't have extras . So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid ? `` Terminator : Salvation '' is first and foremost , a Sci-Fi film which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics , technical jargon , weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition , among others . All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing but it did n't stop any of the grousers from seeing it , anyway . The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor , meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet . I happen to like the `` new '' terminators and there were a bunch ! introduced , and the pace was lightning quick , meaning I had to watch certain segments over , to get full effect . Yes , the acting was two-dimensional at times , but this is a Sci-Fi Action film , and considering Schwartzeneggar 's portrayals in the first three films , not unexpected . Still , the film does n't suffer because of this . The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise . It 's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale , the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter , Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts . It 's sad , too , because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress ! The rest are relative unknowns , with maybe Anton Yelchin Alpha Dog and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions . Still , the performances were good . I wo n't go into specific details of the story , as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST , so as to lay it bare , thinking they were doing us all a favor . Suffice to say , `` Terminator : Salvation '' is as good a Sci-Fi Action film as you are likely to see , until maybe . . . . `` Avatar '' .",f,1

I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE LATEST DVD RELEASE OF TERMINATOR SALVATION DID'NT HAVE THE BONUS FEATURES ON IT . I DO N'T LIKE FACT THAT THE DVD SALES MARKETING IS SHOVING BLUE RAY DVDs AND THAT OBNOXIOUS SECOND DISC OF DIGITAL COPIES DOWN OUR THROATS . WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PAY EXTRA FOR A DIGITAL COPY DISC IF YOU 'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THE DVD MOVIE ONLY ? I ALWAYS BUY DVD WITH BONUS FEATURES BECAUSE IT GOES OVER HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE AND INTERVIEW WITH THE ACTORS AND OTHER MOVIE EXTRAS . THE DVD SALES MARKETERS ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THEY START AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS . AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED IT WAS GIVEN A 3 STAR RATING BY ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE BETTER . THE ACTION SCENES WERE TO A MINIMUM AND IT DRAGGED AT TIMES . I 'M A BIG TERMINATOR FRANCHISE FAN SINCE ITS FIRST RELEASE IN 1985 . I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD 'VE BEEN BETTER .,m,0
"I stopped reading the reviews after a while as I was getting tennis neck . I remember the same reactions to T3 - the purists hated it and the non-fans did n't get it . This is a popcorn movie . Check your brain at the door . It does n't make good use of the Terminator franchise for sure but complaining about what could have been is pointless . If you are a sci-fi or T fan this is a worthy bookend just for the visuals . If you are not very familiar with the T franchise this movie tries to stand on its own with a little narration . Ironically this movie does n't actually advance the Terminator mythology at all since it tries too much to stand by itself . In all cases I think there is something for everyone as long as you remember : this is n't an art film . Woulda coulda shoulda - does n't matter . It is done , this is probably the last movie since the Terminator rights are on the auction block now . Make peace with it . I liked it for what it was - did n't hate it for what it was n't . It 's a glass half full thing . . . ; -",m,1
"If you want to watch a cartoon , buy `` Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs '' or some other Disney animated feature . Or if you want to wander through a game landscape and shoot at robot spiders and flying machines , buy the `` Terminator : Salvation '' game . This DVD should be required to have a warning label like those found on cigarettes . To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement . The animation was of poor quality and the lip-synching for the two characters was non-existent . Even the old Japanese Gozilla and Mothra flicks were done better . Instead of displaying the film in one episode , it was broken up into 6 episodes -- each with beginning and end titles and credits . Hey . . I really enjoyed watching them over and over ad nauseum . If the episodes were different , it might have made this thing more interesting but it was one chase scene after another with the spiders and flying machines shooting endlessly at the two human characters . . . and never hitting them . It reminded me of those blackplotation flicks where the bad guys shoot at the black hero and never hit him while he shoots back and never misses the endless supply of bad guys . Was I disappointed ? Absolutely ! Why did I give it only a `` One-Star '' rating ? Because nothing lower was available .",m,0
"Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie . We finally get an entire movie based around the future war . Not only do we get to see the classic terminators , but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet . Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience .",m,1
"This movie is way out there . . . Not sure where they were trying to go with this movie but , I really ca n't wait till Arnold is no longer playing Governator and gets back to create another actual movie and this one is redone . I was looking to see Terminators such as Arnold , the T-1 's from the original movie , Summer Glau , and Kristianna Loken 's characters in it or at least similarities to them , there was n't . Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold , even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character . Outside of these nuances , the overall movie was good , just not a James Cameron movie and it shows .",m,0
I just do n't get the negative reviews . I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews . I finally decided to watch it last night . I was expecting a lousy flick . What a pleasant surprise . This movie is great . Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three . If you do n't like this movie you just ca n't appreciate originality and great action . 10 STARS OUT OF 10 !,f,1
"I was n't blown away by this installment of the Terminator series , but there was a lot to enjoy from the dirty visuals to the clever use of the original terminator body etc . The Director 's cut however was COMPLETELY unnecessary to release . It 's only about 3 mins longer which is made up from what I noticed of a couple partial nudity shots in the early middle of the film and a fleeting redundant mention of Conner 's mom in a speech he gives over a radio towards the end which I think was added in this version . Really not worth seeing at all . Adds nothing but a small additional length . It did make me laugh though - the conversation that may have lead to re-incorporating the topless bit for the director 's cut : Producer : `` Why are we re-adding this topless shot again ? `` Director : `` DUDE - the audience just is n't going to buy that she 'd want to save him later in the film unless we add this back in . When they see it , they 'll react like , 'Wait a second ! What 's going on ? Why is she saving him ? He has n't even seen her topless yet ! ! ! ' '' Producer : `` Uh huh . . . ``",m,0
"I have not been ale to watch the movie . The seller clearly posted this as HD , but I was too dumb to know the difference . I have no way to play this disc but that 's all on me .

I 'll try to resell it or just donate it if I have too .",m,1

I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off . McG just doesnt get it right I loved the fist 3 movies yea even # 3 I loved the sarah connor chronicles but this movie just wasnt terminator I walked away feeling very dissapointed,m,0
I wo n't add any spoilers here for those of you who do n't know how the movie ends . I liked the movie . . . until the end . What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me . Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that .,m,0
"This film was atrociously bad . I would n't watch it again if it was running free on network TV , much less buy a copy of it . It was pathetic in all aspects . . .",m,0
I did not really like Termin . Salvation too much . Maybe because it 's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring . There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me . For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3 . Peter J . Miller,m,0
"It goes without saying that the `` best '' Terminator film was the first , simply because it *was* the first ! There is something to be said for originality , after all . Still I am far more impressed with `` Terminator Salvation '' for a couple of reasons : First , the theme of the other Terminator films is worn out . How many times can we watch a film about one terminator chasing some people all over the country before it gets old ? I always found the brief war scenes in those films far more intriguing , and I often wondered why the script writers did not include a lot more of them . At last , they have ! The whole film is about the war , and Skynet is no longer some distant , mostly unseen enemy but a true adversary who is visibly present in every scene . That is what I have wanted to see -- the WAR against the machines ! -- not a single terminator chasing people a few people around in circles again . Second , the special effects of this film were awesome . Whatever might be lacking in terms of acting skills which Terminator film had good acting anyway ? , it made up for it with special effects . The Terminators are so realistic that I have literally had a few nightmares about them -- just the kind of scare I love from a movie ! The only aspect that lacked realism is that the Terminators seem to be incompetent marksmen for being such advanced machines . How many rounds does it take to hit a target , after all ? `` Spray and Pray '' seems to be how Terminators shoot , which results in far more misses than hits , and that makes little sense to me when our contemporary computer-guided missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy . It also seems like an awful waste of ammunition to me . Nevertheless , I can see why it is a necessary part of the show . We could not have Terminators who shoot with pinpoint accuracy without blowing away all hope for human victory now , could we ? Ah , such unrealistic elements are a necessary evil . This is science *fiction , * after all ! All in all , this is my personal favorite of all the Terminator films . It may not have the originality of the first , but it is certainly the most impressive in terms of war scenes and special effects . This is why I am giving it a five-star rating .",m,1
The story that are we were waiting for to continue one of the most interesting series of contemporary cinema,m,1
Better than Rise of the Machines but lacking any impact From lead actors . A movie by the numbers relying on CGI and explosions like Star Wars 1 2 & 3 .,m,1
Our only Salvation is Christ . . however if we were all blown to Hell then John Conner may have to do something . . good action sequence and continuous action . . . at times maybe more than I would have liked but . . . hey if its action you want then this movie delivers . .,m,1
"I thought this film was a step up from T3 's Terminatrix nonsense , but it still went downhill in the final 30 minutes as far as plot points go thus getting four stars . The entire film relies on the predictions of the nature of time travel . Several very bad military errors were made , even some by Connor himself , that made me want to choke those who wrote the script . This just takes away from any enjoyment of or engrossment in the action and possible emotions of the film . Cameron 's vision is ultimately lost where characters have not been developed to their full potential . As a woman , I see a failed role model in Blair Williams , who , far from what it appears they were going for , is more of a slut than a girl looking for comfort . I 'm sure the boobery helped to sell the movie , however . The corroborating plot points with T2 are extremely overt and annoying . They were not well-thought out , but thrown in to give a sense of continuity . The parts of Kyle Reese , Sam Worthington , and John Connor are played by excellent actors , and it is their performance that carries this movie along . If not for the bad writing , this film could have been absolutely amazing . For those excellent actors , I still retain that 4 star rating . Even so , the recordings Linda Hamilton made were obviously rushed and I do n't blame her . She was too good for this film . That said , this film should have been the real T3 . I consider it so in my collection . It deserves a place because the predicted War Against the Machines has come . It had to come , and it had to be told , to give any weight to the prophecies of the first two films . Or . . maybe the mystery was better . As for allegations to the Director 's cut not being worth it : it is nonsense to say that getting more film and features is worse than getting a theatrical version . Two minutes is two minutes , and I wanted to see it .",f,1
"I went into this flick expecting a big , fat flop . But what I got was a suspenseful , informative movie with a driving plot , exceptional acting , and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by . I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one . His presence was the kicker . Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye . These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in `` sequel '' doom and , therefore , expected to fail . With Christian being there , you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality , and they did not disappoint . There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around . Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated , it was awesome to see him again in a movie . Actually , it was a bit bittersweet . Because of the success of `` Terminator : Salvation , `` there has been ANOTHER sequel ordered . Let 's see if they can bring it , yet , once again . GREAT JOB TO ALL INVOLVED ! MY TERMINATOR HAT IS OFF TO YOU !",m,1
"I was never a big fan of the Termintor franchise after the first film . I thought T2 had great special effects and a knockout performance by Linda Hamilton and T3 was an amusing send-up but they both lacked the freshness of the original . Thankfully Terminator Salvation takes the series in a completely different direction while still keeping in theme with the first movie . What really makes T4 a thrill for me is that the actors make the most of their somewhat typical screenplay . Christian Bale is good as usual but Sam Worthington , Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin rise above their flatter dialogue and give us characters you want to root for . The special effects in this film are also great , but unfortunatly loose alot of their impact on DVD . The transfer tears a bit and like most things on the small screen it 's easier to pickout where the green-screen begins and the real actors end some of the cooler stunts look laughable on DVD . So like I said , if you liked the movie Terminator Salvation is still a must buy . It you are bothered by an unperfect copy then best to test out the Blu-Ray .",m,1
"In regards to DVD Extra 's , you have to buy the 2-Disc Edition at Target . It has the same extra 's as the blu-ray edition . So if you do n't have a blu-ray player , go to target and get the movie there .",m,0
"**Contains minor spoilers** First off , this is not Arnold 's Terminator . If you 're expecting the same thing as the first three , you 'll be disappointed by this movie . Nor is it a serious philosophical work . It is simply a continuation of the first three , from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light . The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright , two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined . Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet 's prisoner-holding facilities ; in the process , many die . Connor makes it out alive , but so does someone else . . . Wright , who was being held in the facility , emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated . Thus begins a long , twisted path on which both men embark . Along the way , they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other 's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright 's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light . Meanwhile , they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese , in order to manipulate history in their own favor ; at the same time , Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself , offering up a sort of `` Trojan Horse '' in order to take out high command . There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to `` Salvation '' -- personal , and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey . In the end , one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life . Now , aside from my brief retelling trying not to give away too much , my opinion . It 's very well done , and highly enjoyable , to me at least . Obviously , there are many who disagree . But I enjoyed the twists and turns , and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater . Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it ? Yes , if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it . I , however , think it is one of the best , if not the best , in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho . Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters , and I 'm not ; and , frankly , I do n't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one . I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 which I was n't terribly fond of came out . Also , this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything ; for a `` light '' movie which it certainly is , it tends to jump about , and make sudden detours . Not unpleasantly , to me at least , but there it is . My advice ? See it with an open mind , and do n't expect a masterpiece . If you do , you might like it ; I personally thought it was awesome .",f,1
"This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this `` HD '' blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv .

Story was mediocre , and special effects were OK . . . would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise .",m,0
"`` Terminator Salvation '' is the beginning of a new saga in the `` Terminator '' franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron 's hit `` The Terminator '' . Directed by McG , this takes place fifteen years after the events of `` Terminator : Rise of the Machines '' , which ended with the onslaught of `` Judgment Day '' , the day when all the world 's machines rose up against humanity . John Connor , this time played by Christian Bale , is now settled into his prophetized role as Resistance Leader Only Hope for Humanity against the terminator machines . Yet Connor struggles with his mission as the great emancipator warrior and Bale shows this internal strife very well . As we get to know Connor and his ragtag group of rebels , we see the two people entering his life who play major roles in his fight : Marcus , played by Sam Worthington , a death row inmate from several years ago who took part in a scientific procedure which ended up converting him into a human cyborg hybrid and Kyle Reese , well portrayed by Anton Yelchin . Reese , of course , one day becomes the father of John in the earlier Terminator mythos , yet John is tasked with finding him and keeping him alive in this alternate time frame . Though not always as lively , fast paced as the earlier Schwarzenegger films , T-S has a few well produced set pieces for example : the road bridge chase involving Marcus , Reese and a couple of terminator motorcycles ; the capture of rebels by a 20 ft harvester terminator ; and Connor 's battle with a Schwarzenegger cyborg lookalike . The aftermath of Judgment Day has led to his new chapter in Connor 's life and his fulfillment as a savior of humanity and it somehow still works without the presence of Schwarzenegger , simply because it takes the story in a different direction and adds new layers to the original mythology . The Film looks great on Blu-ray : Strong visuals and a clear soundtrack do enough to enhance McG 's vision . A very good addition to one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made .",m,1
"3 stars because I like the movie , but the Director 's Cut is as the others have stated . Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer . Personally I think they could 've kept it at a PG-13 rating . . .",m,0
"Spoilers ! I was having a pretty good time with this movie . The special effects were solid , the storyline fairly cohesive and Sam Worthington 's performance was strong . I fully expected Marcus to not survive the movie , but when they arrived back at the rebel camp I had was pleasantly surprised he survived the fight at Skynet . Then the massive , huge let down with him volunteering his heart to save John Connor . The really irritating part is John nodding to him like `` Good show old chap , I 'll make good use of it '' . Marcus had every bit as much right to `` life '' as it were and was the most compelling character in the film much more so than Connor Bale . He would have made an excellent torch bearer to carry on the fight and could have breathed new life into the series . As it is we get a stupid ending with Bale set for another sequel . For those saying it would ruin any congruity between Salvation and previous films , Connor already stated his mother 's recordings make no mention of such a `` terminator '' - it could be explained as the time line unexpectedly shifting just as it would have if Kyle had been killed . John Connor should have died , Marcus should have lived . The last minute re-write from what I heard spoiled this film for me .",m,0
"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatre and I loved it again when I got my copy on blu-ray , the action sequence , the special effects , the script , well , I was entertained , call me crazy for all those people who gavethis a movie a bad review , the audio and video on blu-ray , I give it 4 out of 5 stars , Sam Worthington , I thinkthat man has a bright future in Hollywood , loved his performance .

I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington ! ! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie . The story line was fantastic and well written also .

"Regardless of whether you get the Director 's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version of Terminator Salvation , you 're in for an average movie viewing experience at best . I was certainly entertained . I love the Terminator movies . . . especially T1 and T2 . I know a lot folks hated T3 ; I for one did not hate T3 . T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2 , but it was n't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound . No , I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average . . . in their own unique ways . And I 'll tell ya , it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie ? Have you heard that ? Oh my God , what a chump . Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale . And you 've got to give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too ; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn the guy who played Reese in the original < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000F9RB9Y '' > Terminator < a > . But the story in Salvation did n't come close to living up to what Terminator or < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B001RIY4WE '' > Terminator 2 : < a > delivered . Salvation 's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations , and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations . How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director 's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series ? Maybe he did n't teeny-bop Salvation , but it was very weeknight CW networked up . Bottom line : Terminator Salvation is a rental",m,0
"Visually and action wise , okay . This is an obligatory part of the series - the problem is that it showed in the directing and script . I think one key part of the plot revealed itself a little soon and tensions could have run a lot higher throughout . The original is still the best . This kind of movie really demands to be taken seriously , although that is probably a little difficult after they botched the sequel to the first installment with that goofy stoned kid , lazy directing , and half baked cheesy lines . It 's a shame since the story is a postulation of things soon to come . If you scoffed at that last comment , look up the word postulate . It really should have been treated with more reverence . Getting around in this wreckage of a fantasy world is too easy . They could have shown off more of the Jeep 's capabilities and the effort needed to make it through some areas . It lacked a journey and was more just snapshots of events . Still decent though if you 've at least seen the first one .",m,1
"From the very first bars of the Coriolan Overture , it is apparent that this is Beethoven at his very best . Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair . There is plenty to discover : sounds and textures never heard before , an orchestral timbre as the composer himself may have envisaged and heard , incredible strength and cohesion and , on the other hand , sensitive nuances that often disappear under a blanket of massed strings in more traditional interpretations . Listen to the period woodwinds , the valveless trumpets and horns , the timpani actually striking the music 's beat ! Enough . As the interpretations go , all three are glorious and fully in tune with the respective works . In the symphonies , Jurowski lovingly takes his time with the first two movements to press on rather relentlessly in the final movements . Believe me : it works . Sound and video of the 2010 recording are great and the Paris audience in the beautiful Th & eacute ; atre des Champs-Elys & eacute ; es is rightly bowled over . Do not miss this disk .",m,1
"There are of course numerous authoritative readings of the pieces recorded in this DVD . The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment , however , is a period instrumental ensemble . There are some people who adamantly refuses to accept any 'period ' performance of Beethoven 's grand symphonies . I approachded this disc with reservation myself , but the performance as recorded quickly dispelled any of my remaining concern . The recorded sound is very good . I first played the disc without viewing , and was rapturous of the accoustics , and much more so as I listened further by the performance . Jurowski has a good credential as an opera conductor . He is in charge currently of the Glyndebourne Festival , and has conducted at Italy , Germany , USA , and at large opera houses , even the MET , all to critical acclaim . Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this musician 's strength lies not only in opera . The wonderful pianist Sviastoslav Richter began his pianistic career doing piano rehearsals for opera houses . Nobody termed the legendary Richter an 'opera pianist ' . What is in the operas , often goes into a composer 's instrumental music , W A Mozart is a clear example to boot . The conducting of Jurowski is clearly dramatic , but at the same time totally idiomatic . You will not find a Beethoven that is like Wagner . Having watched him live , Vladimir is clearly one of those 'conducting before the music ' conductors . For young conducting talents , the No . 7 Symphony here reminds me of Guido Cantelli 's own stereo recording of this masterpiece , a performance that is totally youthful and energised . Jurowski and the OAE comes really close to that legendary reading .",m,1
"Where to begin ? My friend Gerhard Knapp loves this disc see his review . Usually we see eye to eye . In this case , I 'm afraid we 'll have to agree to disagree ! I 've listened to it several times , but I ca n't warm to it . Let me say that my own preference for Beethoven is big-band sumptuous sound . I like the Thielemann Vienna Phil . set . I 'm not fond of the scratchy , honky sounds that emanate from these `` original instruments '' . Sir Thomas Beecham once famously pronounced that they sounded like cats copulating on a tin roof . I would n't go that far , but I do think you have to play the music swiftly if you 're going to minimize the unprettiness of these old instruments . Jurowski plays these symphonies way too slowly , especially the fast movements , so you get a lot of unusual , and for me , unwelcome noises coming through . It is often said that this is how Beethoven heard his music . First of all , his deafness prevented him hearing much of anything , but I 'm convinced that had he been able to appreciate today 's much improved instruments and more skillful players , he would have much preferred this later sound . If you like your Beethoven small , quick and lean , try to hear the Paavo Jarvi set with his Bremen orchestra on Sony DVD . His attack and phrasing are something to behold . Sadly not available from Amazon in the U . S . A , you can get it from `` import cds '' in California , amongst other sources . These are as exciting as any you 'll ever hear , and contain the `` wickedest '' Beethoven # 7 I 've ever heard ! Even a large orchestra guy like me can love this set ! So this Jurowski for me was disappointing , but others may like it better . My advice is get the Jarvi set . It really is remarkable .",m,0

"I read the review where someone said this movie is full frame , so I referenced this movie on dvdplanet . com . Sure enough , it says it 's full frame ! ! Unforgiveable ! ! I think this is 1 of the best movies ever . Who is the bird brained gremmie responsible for sabotaging this dvd ? Grrrrrrr . I was going to buy this dvd , but now I will just record from my ES II laserdisc onto a dvd .",m,0
"It is hard to improve on the original , but this DVD comes real close . Any surf film can show good waves , but what separates ES II is Bruce Brown 's narrative reminiscent of ES , the characters , and how this movie flows . There is enough non-surf events going off that it stays fresh from start to finish . Add this one to the collection , and hope that the formats do n't change too soon .",m,1
Endless Summer II joins its predecessor in the `` Classic Surf '' movie genre . It 's not quite as good as the original or I 'd have given it 5 stars .,m,1
The video show some of the best surfers and breaks ever . The footage is great . Some of the best surf in the world .,m,1
"Communion is a terrifically atmospheric sci-fi that scared the wits out of me . I found the scene in the woods with the lights to be all too familiar . I heard that Walken was and is a total non-believer . He 's sure a great actor . When he was scared trick or treating I jumped out of my skin . Needless to say , I highly recommended this alien abduction movie that 's based on the alleged true recollections of Whitley Strieber . Watch it and see if it rings any bells .",m,1
The product quality is fine . I purchased this move to compare with `` The Fourth Kind '' . Very Interesting similarities .,m,0
". . . watching Walken & Crouse is worth the price of the disc alonehonorable mention to the kid and the 'lil blu guys '' . . . . you know how these things go . . . but all I can say is that Im glad this is not my bedroom . . . . so anyway , try to have a good night . . . . OK ? `` Interestingly I have a 2004 105 min version PAL from Germany [ Die Besucher ] -is cut differentlyand because of PAL 5 % speedup that would mean the film would be about 110 min in NTSC land",m,1
"After watching , you ask yourself , did this really happen ? Frightening . Christopher Walken is always worth watching .",m,0
The movie closely follows the book some say its a hoax a lie or imagination . I say lets find out great story 80 's dated style but an overall bizarre account,f,1
"Communion Special Collector 's Edition 1989 was a three star production in this reviewers opinion . Both Christopher Walken and Lindsay Crouse were excellent , but little else is noteworthy . I will say that the film had several near moments , but always came up short of what could have been done .",m,0
"As most film adaptations of great novels go , this could have been better . There were a few pieces missing that I felt were very important in the book . This movie was more about the effect on the family and just what happened to Whitely . I will say though that Christopher Walken was a great choice . His reactions to the `` visitors '' are just classic .",m,1
"Is Strieber insane . Or is he making this crazy account up to sell books and inspire films ? I 'll have to say yes to the latter . However , do n't let that dissuade you from a creepy film like Communion . Although , the plot is VERY disjointed there are very distubing scenes . Have you ever felt like an alien creature was creeping into your bedroom as you slept ? Well , you will after seeing a scene that depicts exactly that . Memorably disturbing scenes of this nature give this otherwise uninteresting film a decent shelf life .",m,0
"This was a great movie ; and introduced the dynamic acting of Christopher Walken to me . It also scared the you-know-what out of me . I must have seen this movie a dozen times and still get scared each time . If you 've ever had even a remotely similar experience as what is depicted in this movie , you 'll be leaving the lights on at bedtime guaranteed .",m,1
"Where do I begin here ? Molly Ringwald plays an urchin of a girl on a planet that is run by an overlord using young women as sex objects even though he himself is part machine . Sound strange ? Well , it is . Oddly enough , the film is very watchable too largely due to the actors . Peter Strauss is very handsome here and has a slight Han Solo act going . He meets up with Molly Ringwald and their relationship is hard to decipher at times . It seems they always end up sleeping together in silver quilted sleeping bags , her arm draped across him even though he could be her father . Is their relationship romantic or platonic ? Hard to tell here . The special effects are very well done and the scenery beautiful ! There is just enough action and just high enough production and just strange enough situations to keep one interested even though there is n't anything too , too deep here . People searching for a new Star Wars will be disapointed but those who want something sort of offbeat in space will probably like this .",m,1
"Originally released as an 80 's `` 3-D film '' which is why theopening title is so hard to read on conventional TV withall the whizzy meteors flying out , Spacehunter is nonethelessa well made film that does `` take you out of your living room '' . For me , the vehicle designs and the rocky Utah scenary are thebest aspects of the film . The production design is brilliantand the acting convincing . The buggies are fantastic ! Well worth buying but perhaps more for diehard sci-fi fans . Thefilm is not really suitable for younger viewers even though itsmarketed at a `` Star Wars '' audience and has much of that film'scharacter and hardware style . Michael Ironside plays a great villian , a pity we do n't get alittle more of his charcater 's background and how he evolvedinto a villian .",m,1
The movie has a good story line . The actors do a great job . Special effect for 1983 are good . I saw this when it came out in theaters . This was the first movie I watched with Molly Ringwald and became an instant fan . I am glad I added it to my collection .,m,1
"Picture a Tough-hard as nails space captain who owes more money than there is in Fort Knox . . . Pay every one off , easy-just rescue three hot women from a forbidden world . Who can he call on for help , a money hungry space-cop , a hot robot bombshell , a junker space ship that 's just spare parts flying in formation , and a young survivor girl . If you enjoy fighting mutants , rescuing damsels in distress and good one liners , here 's your movie .",m,1
Kind of like `` Mad Max '' in space . A sci-fi B movie but I find it entertaining . But then I like Sci Fi B movies,m,0
"ok , so this is n't the best sci-fi movie ever but it really is fun , if you can get into it . this adventure looks like a cross between `` road warrior '' and `` alien '' as it tells the story of a bounty hunter wolfe peter strauss , tring hard but just not han solo landing on a planet ravaged by plage to rescue three ladies who crashed there and are being held hostage by the strangest villian ever overdog michael ironside looking like a borg and being a grade a ham ! young molly ringwald is on hand as is ernie hudson to help strauss get the girls back . slow in places and some really strange encounters with the planets other citizens make it a mixed bag , but as i said if you can get into the spirit of fun you may find that you like this one also ! give it a try !",m,1
"This is one of my favorite movies . I watched this way back , and I later bought the tape when the price was $ 25 and considered it a great value . I still watch that movie once in a while . It 's high adventure and an all together great movie .",m,1
"Three years after `` Facts of Life , `` but a year away from her triumphant role in `` Sixteen Candles , `` Molly Ringwald finds herself the prisoner of some tricked-out bum named Overdog on a junk planet that looks like Fred Sanford 's backyard . Peter Strauss , the poor man 's Richard Chamberlain , plays the poor man 's Han Solo or Lone Starr , if you prefer and tries to rescue her . Yes , `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' is low-budget fun directed by Lamont Johnson . According to the IMDb , Johnson once played Tarzan on radio . With this movie , he shows a keen radio performer 's eye for cinema . Ripping off `` Star Wars '' and `` Road Warrior '' and featuring more rickety metal garbage than any four episodes of TLC 's `` Junkyard Wars , `` this flick has a spunky little heart but little else to offer . Ringwald would go on to become John Hughes ' teen muse and the undisputed 80s teen comedy queen , usually playing upper middle class girls dating sexless , nonthreatening gimps like Andrew McCarthy . Here , she 's a punky little spitfire who needs a bath and a shave . Come to think of it , she IS the spunky little heart of this movie . The rest of it can go to hell ! But I kid `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone . `` It 's a silly movie with a clumsy title , yet worth watching with friends some drunken evening . But please- try not to confuse `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' with `` Metalstorm : the Destruction of Jared Synn . `` They both have colons in their titles , and promise things like `` adventures , `` `` destruction '' and `` Jared Synn . `` But only `` Spacehunter : Adventures in the Forbidden Zone '' has Molly Ringwald being tortured by Michael Ironside . Ask for it by name !",m,0
"This movie has a serious pacing problem . It runs very slow in most of the non-action parts , but runs quickly in the action sequences . The dialog is terrible . Give nervous actors non-natural dialog and the whole movie looks more like a bad high school production . Molly Ringwald character tends to ramble on and on . Midway through , the movie forgets it is in 3D . One sequence in particular , walking across the desert , goes on and on . I watched Spacehunter in 1983 in the theater . It was my first 3D movie . I thought it was a good b-movie at the time . Viewing the same movie now shows me it had lots of ideas but not much money . Somehow , the non action sequences go slowly and the characters are just doing exposition instead of reacting to what happens .",m,0
"The picture quality is photographic and now I can hear the birds chirping at the start of Commando . . . bliss ! Having to rent these classic movies in VHS format has hindered my full appreciation of their outstanding quality . For those like myself who are too young to have seen them on the big screen , watching Commando is a new and delightful experience . Although I am not a huge fan of violent movies , I can assure you that Commando is one of the best 'comedies ' of all time with almost enough memorable quotes to rival Fawlty Towers ! Running Man is my favorite of this collection only surpassed by True Lies as my favorite Arnie . And with the inclusion of Predator and Total Recall , none of the titles are 'fillers ' unlike other collections , these are all blockbusters . You 'll love Commando for the commedy , Running Man for the action , Total Recall for the sci-fi , and Predator for the adrenaline rush . Other great features include : Dolby Pro-Logic sound for all Total Recall has Dolby Digital and both widescreen and normal versions of Total Recall . I had high expectations . I was not dissappointed .",m,1
"action , Action , ACTION , and . . . Yes , thats right , more hard-hitting action . Arnie really knows what his audience wants . I will now review each film individually . TOTAL RECALL . With perfect doses of Action , Sci-fi and Special Effects , this film is a near perfect Action Sci-fi . Arnie acting is at its best and the supporting cast including Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox are all very believable . 5 STARS . PREDATOR . Another Perfect Action Sci-fi what would you expect from the director of Die Hard < p > Everything in it the Music , the cast , the sets all combine to give the film a certain feel like in the alien films The sction and violence comes hard and fast and the special effects by the Brilliant Stan Winston are State-of-the-art . 5 STARS . THE RUNNING MAN . A chilling view of the world to come . Arnold is back as he promised to be and in one of his most violent and exciting movies . The bad guys are also some of the toughest Arnie has faced , Sub-zero and Buzz-saw to name two and the sets are frighteningly realistic . Might be a bit rough for some . as with all of these movies 5 STARS . COMMANDO . If Rambo had a Daughter , he would be Commando . This has to have one of the highest body counts of any American Movies . Non-stop Action and Laughs . the laughs come from the classic lines Arnie gives , EG . When he drops a man off a cliff and says & quot ; I let him go & quot ; . 5 STARS .",m,1
"An exellent DVD , featuring all the great players of past and present , full of highlights interviews and exellent story line , describing each of an ultimate player 's skill , like scoring , speed , mentality , etc . Exellent music to go with the story , and the final highlight featuring michael jordan could'nt be better even thou I 'm a Laker Fan , wich made me also order ultimate jordan eventualy .",m,1
this movie is a surprisingly delightful comedy . any movie that makes you laugh is great,f,1
"My Best Friend 's Wedding is probably Julia Roberts best romantic comedy , even better than Pretty Woman . Dermont Mulroney , Cameron Diaz , and Rupert Everett also star in this tale of a food critic played by Roberts who is invited to intend her best friend 's upcoming nupitals , but the thing is she is in love with her best friend and tries everything in her power to break up the wedding . I wo n't give away the ending but this is actually a good and solid romantic comedy and I think everyone who decides to watch will throughly enjoy it . Good luck !",f,1
I enjoyed this deliteful romantic comedy . I am not much of a Julia Roberts fan But I enjoyed her in this movie .,f,1
I was very glad this movie did n't end up being a silly romance and break the couple up just to rekindle an old relationship ! A good watch for a dull Saturday afternoon .,f,0
"After a five-years Break ! ! ! Julia Roberts is back ! Cooler , sexier , funnier and better than ever !

"First of all . . . I loved it ! Talk about a film that anyone willenjoy , this is it . For those close-minded movie-goers who think thatthis film is just for & quot ; women-only & quot ; or that you should go see it & quot ; just to please your significant other & quot ; , then you are completely wrong . < p > You will like , if not love this film . The humor is funny , the acting superb , and story believable . Julia Roberts and Dermot Mulroney are excellent as & quot ; best friends & quot ; and Rupert Everett 's character will make you laugh out loud . < p > Anyone who has ever had a member of the opposite sex for a best friend will find that this movie hits a nerve . . . or should I say & quot ; funny bone & quot ; .

END",m,1
If you have ever fallen in love this movie is for you . It shows the ups and downs of what can happen if you get in the way of a wedding . It shows how horrible we can get when we have our mind on one thing and try to kill everything in our path . It is a really good movie . Julia Roberts is really good . The music they pick for it was good it went with what was going on . Every piece of film was needed in order to tell the story . It will make you think about who to make your best friend .,f,1
THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC . . . . IT HAS LINES THAT HAVE YOU REPEATING OVER AND OVER AGAIN . . . . MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE WATCHING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER . . . ITS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE .,f,1
"First off , Julia Roberts to me is an actress who has become more beautiful with age even to this day . Having said that , I was anxious to see this movie because of her and Cameron Diaz . I have seen My Best Friend 's Wedding three times and I must admit that I have viewed it differently each time I 've seen it . What I mean by this is that I have never really been able to decide which woman the groom should end up with ; his bride-to-be or his best friend . Granted , Julia does every rotten thing she can in this film to break up her best friend 's wedding so from that viewpoint I favored him ending up with Cameron . On the other hand as one reviewer put it , Julia and her best friend had more chemistry than the groom and his bride-to-be so from that viewpoint I also favored him ending up with Julia . During the film , there are times when I rooted for Julia to get her man despite her despicable efforts to win him over yet other times I wanted Cameron to end up with the groom . This movie still entertains me even after knowing the outcome . Aside from the simple plot of breaking up the wedding , this film has good humor , good acting , a decent soundtrack , and is overall a believable chick flick for the most part . Even guys like myself should find it to be entertaining as I am normally picky when it comes to chick flicks . The special edition dvd is worth picking up if you have n't seen the features . One of the featurettes shows the original alternative ending which is much different from how the film originally ended . Which of the two endings are better ? Only the viewer can decide . As for me , I 'm not telling . Anyway , the bonus features are overall good and plentiful . The only problem is that the camera focus on one of the featurettes is somewhat off and distorts the picture a bit . Nothing too serious but very noticable . I suppose a sequel to this movie would have been interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out ?",m,1
"I do n't understand all the fuss about Julia Roberts , she does n't play very well and she is n't even good looking ! Cameron Diaz instead is magnificiant in her role , she 's totaly convincing and really beautiful . This movie deserves 5 stars mainly because she 's in it . The story is quite good , it 's funny at times . If you want some entertainement or you want to see Cameron Diaz , buy this movie .",m,1
"MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDDING is a hilarious romantic-comedy . Julia Roberts is truly at her best in this film as Julianne , a food critic who 's long-time childhood best friend , Michael Dermot Mulroney is getting married to some other woman , just when Julianne starts to have feelings for him ! The woman Michael is marrying is Kimberly Cameron Diaz , a college student with a fillthy-rich father . Julianne is hopelessly in love with Michael , so to get Michael back , Julianne must find a way to stop the wedding and make Michael fall in love with Julianne herself ! She gets her partner and friend , George Rupert Everett , to help her win over Michael . The ending is actually surprising , because you 'd think Julianne wins back Michael , but she actually does n't . So it is good to see the protagonist in a film to not get what they want in the end , but can still have a happy ending . The whole cast is absolutely superb ! And one of my favorite scenes is when Julianne and George pretend that they just got engaged George is really gay , and while meeting Kimberly 's family for dinner and they ask how George proposed to Julianne , George starts singing the song `` I Say A Little Prayer '' , and then everyone else in the cast starts joining in , except for Julianne and Michael . It 's a very funny movie with a witty script . If you have not yet seen MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING , then what are you waiting for ? But definitely get the special edition DVD for this movie because it 's better than the other DVD . I just love MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING ! Great date movie , too . A must see .",f,1
"Dont get me wrong . This isnt a bad film . its not a excellent one either . Julia roberts came across as pathetic , and a little unlikeable , as she tried to steal her best friend from his marriage to kimmy cameron diaz . there are quite a few good scenes in this film . The restaraunt scene is very enjoyable , where the whole table erupts with singing . it is a very bitty film in my opinion , all over the place . dont expect a typical romance , because you will be sorely dissapointed .",f,0
"This is one of my favorite movies . I 've watched it over and over again 'coz I was captivated by the story and cast . I really loved this flick , it 's really hilarious , and cute ! Julia looks great in the movie , and she truly did a good job . This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and gets you thinking what you really want , and who you are . Go watch it !",f,1
This is my daughter 's all-time favorite movie and has been on her wish list since she started it . I was happy to FINALLY get a copy for her . It arrived in excellent condition and very promptly . The seller was great and my daughter has already selected her charmingly handsome gay escort should her `` best '' friend-boy marry .,f,1
"IT 'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE . . . . SHOWS US THE FOIBLES OF LIFE AND HOW EVERYTHING GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHEN MR . RIGHT COMES ALONG . JULIA ROBERTS IS PERFECT IN THIS ROLE AND DERMOT MULRONEY CAN HOLD HIS OWN ON SCREEN WITH HER . LOVE CAMERON DIAZ AS THE 'OTHER WOMAN ' . PATS ON THE BACK FOR THE CAST SELECTIONS HERE , NOBODY PLAYS A BAD PART . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I HAVE VIEWED IT MANY TIMES AND I WILL WATCH IT MANY MORE TIMES IN THE FUTURE .",f,1
"I love this movie ! ! One of my all time favorite movies with a bitter sweet ending so to speak . I love all the actresses actors that are in it , they did a great job ! !",f,1
"Julia Robert 's character , Julianne , sums up the entire movie in one line near the end ; 'Since I got here , I have done nothing but underhanded , despicable , not even terribly imaginative things . 'That 's not to say that there are not some very funny moments in this movie , most of which are musical . The opening credits are a brilliant rendition of `` Wishin ' and a Hopin ' , the karaoke bar scene where a young , scene-stealing Cameron Diaz puts everything into an off-key , `` Do n't know what to do with myself '' , the restaurant scene with a wonderful ensemble `` Say a Little Prayer . `` Heck , even the helium-balloon singing is funny . But overall the movie consists of watching as Julia Robert 's character does 'nothing but underhanded , despicable , not even terribly imaginative things ' , before the obvious redemption at the end .",m,0
"Julianne Potter Julia Roberts has everything that is required to be a romantic comedy heroine - wild hair , a huge smile , a gay best friend Rupert Everett and a dilemma in her love life . Her best friend ex-boyfriend , Michael Dermot Mulroney has just called her out of the blue , leaving a message on her answermachine telling her to call him - urgently . < p > Julianne remembers that years ago , she and Michael vowed to marry each other if they were both still single at 28 . She 's going to turn 28 , and leaps to a happy conclusion . However , on returning his call , he drops the bombshell - he 's getting married to somebody else . This weekend . Well , what 's a girl to do ? Armed with her afore-mentioned gay best friend , George , Julianne sets off to Chicago to see what she can do about breaking up the couple and securing Michael for herself . < p > His fianc & eacute ; e , Kimmy Cameron Diaz is 20 years old and Barbie doll perfect . She does n't even have a tiny flaw that Julianne can use against her . She is extra-super-nice to Julianne , giving her the position of Maid Of Honour within half an hour of meeting her and bringing all the defences down to admit to her that she is jealous of her relationship with Michael . < p > Julianne is ruthless . She 'll do whatever it takes to get Michael back - and she does a lot of it . She tries to embarrass Kimmy at a karaoke bar , but despite a terrible singing voice Kimmy has chutzpah and wins the audience around . In a bid to make Michael jealous , she convinces George to pose as her husband which he does with pizzazz describing their first meeting , he muses wistfully , `` I knew we 'd end up like this - like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza '' . And finally she writes a nasty email to Michael 's boss , supposedly from Kimmy 's father . < p > This is the turning point of the movie . Up until now we have seen Julianne as the heroine and Kimmy as the foe who must be obliterated at all costs . And this is perhaps where we realise that maybe this is n't just another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . But now , maybe we do n't want Julianne to win any more . Maybe , just maybe , sweet Kimmy should be the one to end up with Michael . It 's not so clear-cut now , and the script keeps us guessing until the end . < p > Roberts gives a great performance here , making Julianne sympathetic even when we do n't like her very much . She does n't have much chemistry with Mulroney as Michael , but then nor does Diaz ; perhaps this is the point of the movie . However it is Rupert Everett who manages to steal almost every scene he is in . It 's very enjoyable , and slightly black - but only if you want to see that side of it . One to watch .",f,1
"OK , so the restaurant scene where everyone breaks out singing & quot ; I Say A Little Prayer & quot ; is cute . But this is NOT the strikingly original comedy it 's touted to be . I mean , it ends with a chase scene for crying out loud and who but Julia Roberts would not be facing grand theft auto -- or grand theft bread van -- charges after such a stunt . From the director of the delightfully off-beat & quot ; Muriel 's Wedding , & quot ; I expected more . Well , it is possible to do weddings to death and maybe that much can be said of P . J . Hogan 's directorial efforts . < p > The attractive cast and the occasional chuckle make & quot ; My Best Friend 's Wedding & quot ; worth seeing -- once ! Unless you 're a die-hard Julia Roberts or Cameron Diaz fan , it 's hard to imagine wanting to own a copy .",m,0
"MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING is definitely my favorite wedding film . With an all-star cast including Julia Roberts , Dermot Mulroney , Cameron Diaz , and Rupertt Everett , it makes this film even more worth-watching . Julianne Roberts is a food critic who soon realizes she loves her best friend , Michael Mulroney , the day he decides to marry Kim , a perky blonde from a very wealthy family Diaz . Determinded to win him back , Julianne will do anything to break up the couple 's wedding - and she only has four days , with the help of her . . . friend , George Everett . Every scheme to win Michael back is , of course , hilarious . < p > MY BEST FRIEND 'S WEDDING is an excellent , feel-good romantic comedy about one who finds true love for the right person at the wrong time . Will Julianne win Michael ? You 'll have to see this to learn the answer ! But it 's actually very surprising at the end . This film is very original , too . This film is definitely worth watching !",f,1
"In my opinion , it is n't the character played by Dermot Mulroney who is the best friend of Julia Roberts ' character . It is Rupert Everett , her gay friend . It is Rupert who flys out to support her in her travail over Mulroney 's upcoming marriage , giving her his time , his care and his affection . What an amazing person ! I love Julia Roberts and go to any movie she makes , but the character she plays in this movie is immature and not very sympathetic . However , it is the very immaturity of her character that leads to all the conflict , so I ca n't complain too much ! Overall , the movie has some extremely funny moments .",f,1
This movie is great . I have watched it several times . The acting is great and there is alot of fun to be had .,f,1
"I have to agree with the analysis of a recent reviewer who points out the self-centeredness of the lead characters in this Chicago-based tale . Food critic Julianne Potter Julia Roberts and sports broadcaster , Michael O'Neil Dermot Mulroney had promised while in college that they would marry each other if neither had married before they were 28 , which right there makes love seem like a game where they are concerned . But three weeks before Julianne is to turn 28 , Michael announces his engagement to a 20-year-old college student named Kimberly Wallace the always sunny Cameron Diaz , much to Julianne 's dismay , and realizing her own feelings for Michael , tries to sabotage the impending nuptials -- a scenario which , with the skillful writing of Ronald Bass and the skillful direction of P . J . Hogan becomes one of humor and pathos , rather than just one of completely outright meanness and manipulation . Kimberly embraces Julianne , and after knowing her only a few minutes , makes her her Maid of Honor , a role she pretends to play while trying to create friction between the couple , using various methods , and lastly employing her gay friend , George Downes Rupert Everett to pose as her fiance , hoping to make Michael jealous . Much of this film 's entertainment value comes from the well-chosen cast . Philip Bosco and Susan Sullivan portray the bride 's dignified parents Walter and Isabelle Wallace , Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston are Samantha and Mandy Newhouse , like-dressing characters from the South , who will also serve as bridesmaids , Chris Masterson as the Best Man-to-be is a fairly shy , and awkward youth , although , along with a few peer group members , he gives one of the most amusing scenes in the movie , which involves helium , Paul Giamatti plays Richard , an empathetic bellman , Harry Shearer plays Jonathan P . F . Ritt , and M . Emmett Walsh plays Joe O'Neal . More delightful moments occur during an outing at a seafood restaraunt , where , while conjuring up a story behind their fake engagement , George leads everyone in singing Dionne Warwick 's `` I Say a Little Prayer '' , and when one of the bridesmaids gets her tongue stuck on an ice sculpture . Things come to a head when Julianne follows George 's advice and finally reveals her true feelings as Kimberly stumbles upon the scene , and a viewer can only hope for some just resolution . For me , this film has called to mind the lyrics of a 1958 song by Don Cornell called `` Play Some Music for Broken Hearts '' , in which the final stanza is : `` Play some music for broken hearts . Play it slower and slower . For our love is over , and tonight we must part . . . `` Maybe it was n't love . Maybe it was just more a desire to always win at all costs . But it was time for something definite to be done about Michael and Julianne 's relationship , and at least someone got to dance at the other 's wedding .",f,1
"This is a fun movie and will hold the attention of most female viewers ; my wife thoroughly enjoyed the movie and watched it to the very end . Julia Roberts as Julianne Potter is a touching character who has a real problem making up her mind as to what kind of a friend she wants her best friend to be . Her best friend , Michael O'Neal , played by Dermot Mulroney just happens to be a guy she 's known for many years . Things go along OK until he announces his intentions of getting married ; that announcement triggers a strong reaction that serves as the basis for the movie . Although the movie is a bit dated , it 's still funny and engaging to watch . It may be good to watch it once just to see what you think about it before buying . On the other hand why not just roll the dice , pay your $ 7 . 36 and get a new copy of your very own ? If you have any women in the household you should be on safe ground .",m,1
"HYPOTHERMIA is one of those `` creature features '' that would have been more successful had the film gone more humorous or campy . Unfortunately , the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver 's suit ! Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes . Blood and gore are utilized but tame compared to current standards . At only 73 minutes , HYPOTHERMIA passes quickly , so it might work as a double bill on Halloween !",m,0
"Being a big time horror fan and a diehard collector I love this movie alot , the acting and special effects were right on point . You encounter a lake monster in the dead winter was a brilliant idea and concept , the monster effects was hands down freaking awesome and unique . Hypothermia is a downright horror science fiction monster you must have in your collection of monster films . Having this film in my horror collection is truly a honor , hats off to MPI Media Group , Glass Eye Pix and Dark Sky Films for bringing and distributing this film to horror fans like myself who live and breathe horror films . Hypothermia gets 2 thumps , a perfection 10 and 5 stars . . . HYPOTHERMIA KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE GENRE OF MONSTER HORROR FILMS :",m,1
"Visually masterful underground cinema . The bleak , but beautiful setting of the frozen lake is warped by a minimalistic luciferian score . The pacing is hypnotic , at times slow , but meditative . I enjoyed the plot , which was a tongue-in-cheek combination of fishing , family drama , and horror . It was a weird mix of exactly what you 'd expect and complete ridiculousness . It could use some more tits and more gore , but maybe that will happen in part 2 . The acting is b-movie camp outside of Michael Rooker and Amy Chang . You 've got to listen closely to grab some of the bizarre stuff the characters say with straight faces . It seems that swimming below the traditional genre flourishes there is a subversive social message . I definitely did n't watch it for the relevant message , but instead enjoyed it for the eerie tension and creepiness . This is my favorite McKenney film with Automatons trailing close behind it .",m,1
"I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks ' The Mahabharata on DVD , and today it arrived . How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS . I have not watched this version yet , but I can not believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc . So a warning to everyone : if you want the full miniseries , THIS IS NOT IT !",m,0
"I was raised on stories from the Mahbharata and my parents showed me this movie when I was about ten years old . Even though it is low budget and very , very long , I loved it . I started showing it to my friends , who have no Indian background or knowledge at all and they loved it too . I 'll never forget when we were about thirteen years old we started watching it at a sleepover and were too tired to finish . In order to see the whole thing before our moms came to take us home we would have to wake up at 6:00 am . I decided we would schedule the rest for another time , since sleeping in is a part of a sleepover . To my surprise my friends all woke up at 6:00 to see the rest . It is an amazing story that grows bigger than itself somehow .",f,1
"I can not comment on how faithful this is to the original . Nor can I comment on whether or not it may or may not be offensive to Hindus . I do n't know . I hope it is n't , however , because it is certainly a beautiful work of theatre as art . My family begged me to watch this for years and years , but with raising a family , I just did n't have a spare 5-6 hours . Recently , however , I finally had time -- and it was so worth it . The performance was so finely acted and directed . I think especially of the brother who tells a lie for the first time . How he touches his lip after the words are spoken , amazed that untruth could come out of his mouth . I think about the actor who played Krishna -- Wow ! And especially , the actor who plays the old blind king . That is just so well done . At any rate , if it is offensive to Hindus , then do n't see it . But if it is n't , then it is truly worth the time .",f,1
"Mahabharata , directed by Peter Brook , is a great movie . It is a must see for all who are interested in epic mythology and who would like to understand more about the religious philosophies and culture of India . As an Indian I have heard countless stories about Mahabharata and seen many Indian movies based on Mahabharata . The story is vast and often spawned many discussions on arguments on why things were what they were - the plot , chartecters , etc . I first saw the theatrical version of the Peter Brook version in 1989 , and was amazed by the beauty and grandeur of the production and also was quite impressed how effectively the strory was told and enacted by an international cast of stage and screen actors . Mahabharata is a must collect item and worth watching once every year ! ! !",m,1
"Many reviews here deplore the butchered three-hour version with good reason . Be sure to scroll down to the DVD details to make sure you are getting the six-hour version . There is a Hindi version of this great epic , which was very popular in India , but it is extremely long , with many digressions that Western audiences will find distracting . The Peter Brook version has been painstakingly translated and designed and made accessible to a modern Western audience , much the way Laurence Olivier did with his Shakespeare movies . For those with intelligence and sensibility -- i . e . for adults -- this is one of the most profound stories they will ever see . For those without -- i . e . for adolescents -- it will be a bore . The Mahabharata is longer than and as ancient as the Bible . Some of the parallels between the two are too close to be mere coincidence : the Trinity , virgin birth , prophecy , someone who is born and raised like Moses but is given a different role to play by destiny . The story of Krishna in the complete Mahabharata not included in the Brook even parallels that of Jesus . It is no coincidence that both Krishna and Jesus are called `` Lord '' . Although the Mahabharata is indeed a `` secular '' history , it contains within it the most sacred of all Hindu texts , the Bhagavad Gita , with its universal precepts . This is the story upon which an entire civilization bases its culture . For Peter Brook to bring its essence to a beautifully staged play is a stupendous achievement . His eclectic casting may not be to everybody 's liking , and sometimes the accents are a bit thick . But the acting itself is fine . By the way , the father of mankind is . . . the storyteller . See this . It can change your life .",m,1
"Poor quality VHS . Topic is superb , acting was excellent and the overall production was terrific . Just the quality of the video was n't up to my expectations .",m,0
"I rate this a 4 only because I have n't seen the DVD yet , but a friend once loaned me the VHS version . I think I watched it three times over the course of a couple months . In one case , I watched all 6 hours straight through minus bathroom breaks of course . Another reviewer used the phrase & quot ; life changing & quot ; , and I agree completely . I have continued to draw inspiration from this film for 5 years . With the DVD , maybe I can go for another 50 . PS : The soundtrack for this film is out on RealWorld . Also recommended .",m,1
"THE DVD I GOT IS NOT VERY GOOD , IT DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND THE IMAGE IS BLURRY , BUT IS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I TRIED TO GET THIS PRODUCT , SO I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME . THANK YOU , BEATRIZ BELTRAN .",f,1
"I did n't realize how good 'Song of Norway ' was until I watched this film , which is almost as bad as Gilliam 's 'Jabberwocky ' . Peter Brook , like Terry Gilliam , is one of the great charlatans of our time . Each man is a self-important destroyer of good literature . Whatever Gilliam touches he turns into boring uncleanness . Whatever Brook touches he turns into a model of his own ininteresting self . There is neither health nor beauty in Brook 's 'Mahabharata ' . If you want to watch a proper 'Mahabarata ' , get the Chopra version . Brook 's 'international ' version is squalid , boring , and all wrong . It will be enjoyed only by the illiterate and the perverse . Let me say something in passing . The RSC has been for at least three decades an example of all that is bad in the modern arts world . When will British critics stop treating it as a divine manifestation ? We British have suffered horribly at the hands of our home-grown 'talents ' since the 1960s . Some day we 'll get a healthy-minded director who will make faithful films of the John Buchan novels . Many of us are fed up with directors whose minds are unclean and utterly dull . The duty of a film-maker is to enchant , to entertain : but Peter Brook has no sense of duty , and so his 'Mahabharata ' has zero entertainment value .",m,0
"In reading the positive reviews of the movie , I was wondering if one needed to take some kind of exotic drugs to write them , and then I wondered would n't it be easier just to take the drugs and forget the movie ? Honestly , this one of the worst films I have ever seen since `` Plan 9 From Outer Space '' and the `` Freddy Got Fingered . `` The production values were poor to say the least . It was hard to identify the the characters and their motivations because no one stands out . Most of the characters were pretty uninteresting or strange , i . e . , the woman who gave birth to a bowling ball for example . [ Seriously , it is in there . I 'm not making it up . ] I could not figure out the lineages of the families because they were a pretty mixed group . There was even a Kung Fu master in the film and that part was a bit like Kung Fu meets the Sons of Hercules . Which begs the question , if you are going to have a Kung Fu master why not attack helicopters and rocket grenades , too ? Could any film be worse ? No , actually -- this is pretty bad . It is like watching a bad Star Trek movie if you are n't a fan of Star Trek or familiar with the myth or back-story . One point the woman 's future husband is blind so she chooses to wear a blindfold for the rest of her life . What that accomplishes I do n't know but there it is . If you like really bad gladiator movies , this could be your film . Yikes !",m,0
"Warning to Moms of young children . I let my 4 year watch this movie . She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying `` I Hate My Life '' . When I asked her where she learned to say that and she said from the Barbie movie . Sure enough , that 's what Barbie says in it . I am shocked phrases like this were in a Barbie movie and I am very disappointed",f,0
"Very disappointed by the preview . My daughter loves all of the Barbie videos and is now very interested in a video that highlights `` sophmore year , `` and `` did he kiss you ? ! `` comments . Up until now Barbie videos have been based on fantasy play and imaginative play and this new viedo applies to real life situations that are too old for the crowd of girls it has always appealed to . Lions Gate or Mattel has , in my opinion , missed the mark on this one . Any parent who buys this Barbie Diaries video for their young daughter is just wishing their youth away .",f,0
My biggest complaint with this Barbie movie is the line from Barbies guy friend expressing excitement at walking in on a `` girl hug '' . Do we really need that kind of suggestive remark in a Barbie movie aimed at girls ages 5 to 12 ?,f,0
"This movie is inappropriate for young children under 8 for whom the other Barbie Princess movies were the target audience . We received as a gift and I 'm sure the giver thought this movie would be in line with the others . It is not due to very inappropriate messages : 1 If your make-up gets confiscated , keep extra hidden in the pocket of your coat . 2 Getting boys to like you is most important in High School . 3 Getting boys to kiss you is even more important . 4 Getting good grades will make everyone hate you . These things may happen in high school , but this is n't an appropriate message for 5 year olds . Shame on Barbie , shame on Mattel !",f,0
"< a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B003U0AAJ8 '' > The Barbie Diaries : Widescreen Edition < a > The movie over all was pretty good in my opinion . The story line was n't really original but interesting enough to keep me watching . It 's a typical high school movie . Barbie starts a new year in high school . Barbie has a crush on the most popular guy in school . Barbie has an enemy who is dating her crush . All those kind of stuff . Aside from the story line , the animation was okay . I felt as though the background clothes were bland . It was like the creators only focused on making the main characters look cool that they were too lazy to design the background people . The best part of the movie in my opinion was the music . I enjoyed the beginning and ending music a lot . The beginning music was called `` This is Me '' by Skye Sweetman . Overall the movie taught the old moral of `` believing in yourself '' and showed the stereotypical view of high school . There is really no original idea in the movie . If you like the stereotypical , this movie is for you . But if you want something more original , try something else .",f,0
"The animation is jerky , Barbie looks odd and nothing like herself . She 's portrayed as a highschool student , but acts like a middelschool student . Poorly written , poorly animated . My 8 year old daughter loves Barbie movies , and she asked me if we could send this one back .",f,0
"My daughter loves the Barbie DVD 's , this one included , but I definitely think it 's aimed towards an older audience than my 4 year old daughter . That being said , she still highly enjoyed it I think mostly because of the music and it was worth every penny to see the smile on her face when she watched it . I was disappointed by the graphics on it though . The other Barbie movies appear to be made better than this one as far as the graphics go .",f,0
shows those avid barbie fans that growing up is sometimes hard but that things work out when you believe in yourself,f,0
I am the mother of a Barbie-obsessed 4-year-old and bought this unaware of the plot . I like the movie but think it 's too mature for my daughter right now . It would be great for a girl in middle school however . I did find it entertaining .,f,1
"I got this for my 7 year old daughter . She thinks boys have cooties at this age . Especially her brothers . I did take away one star for the `` girl hug '' comment because I thought it probably went a little too far in a movie that is geared towards a younger crowd . It was okay , though , because it went WAY over her head . However , hormones were n't the only message . What I liked was the message that the popular kids were only popular because they said nasty things about each other . I liked that Barbie learned that the hunky guy on the rebound was n't the boy who made her feel the best deep down in her heart . I liked that Barbie wrote down her wishes and made them come true . I got this movie yesterday afternoon . My daughter has already watched this movie three times . She dug through her stuff to find her charm bracelet and has been scribbling in a notebook all day long .",f,1
"Personally thought this was a great film , most young girls or teens can relate toThe graphics are probably the best yet out of the rest of the barbie moviesI also did not think that the movie was too mature for young audiences as a previous reviewer statedThe scene when Kevin commented on the girls hugging was n't in any way , shape or form meant to be crudeAnyone should be able to see , that Kevin only tries to find ways to be get barbie to realize how much he loves her . It saddens me , to see that someone could have such a negative outlook over such innocent emotionsI suppose it 's because of reviews like that , why television cencors everything now days",m,1
"Honestly , I like ALL the Barbie movies . They are a little cheezy and have fun story lines that anyone can enjoy . But this one is differnt . First of all , it has a GREAT soundtrack ! I absolutely love the music . I 'm 26 years old and would have the songs on my playlist and no one would ever know it was from a Barbie movie if they had n't seen it . This movie is geared toward older kids , but my younger kids love it as well . I also like the movie . Having to on occasion watch a movie 20 times in a row , having a movie you can enjoy can really help ease the pain of repetitive movies . The story line is a lot better than some of the fantasy based ones . The dialog is fun and more mature . All in all , great movie !",f,1
"I 'm a teenager and I love Barbie movies ! I also collect Barbies . I think that all of the previous , fantasy-like Barbie Movies are very nice . When i first heard the idea of this movie , I really did n't like the sound of the fact that it was going to have Barbie in school . I liked the storyline , and fantasy of the rest of the movies . It sort of makes little kids think the wrong things about high school ; its all about liking boys , and you do n't have to do school work , and you do n't have to work hard .",f,0
The acting and story are superb . Blending a great western and history lesson in the what occurred in the late 1800 's . If you are a Robert Duvall fan you will love it !,m,1

Others have mentioned the pros cons of this movie ; I just think it 's one of the best Westerns out there -- > great acting , a definite unique twist to the usual Western storyline , and it 's based I do n't know how loosely on a true story . 3 . A definite 5 star .",m,1
An awesome movie . I had seen it twice and decided I had to own it !,f,1
"I thought good westerns died with John Wayne , but this movie will rank high with the classic westerns of yesteryear . Robert Duvall has true grit .",m,1
"Walter Hill 's Broken Trail is a good but at times a little too leisurely Western miniseries following Robert Duvall and his nephew Thomas Haden Church as they try to drive a herd of horses across country only to become sidetracked when they find themselves the unlikely guardians of five Chinese girls being shipped to a brothel - and the target of some bad men determined to relieve them of both . . . It 's curious how Robert Duvall , and actor who came to prominence playing a mob lawyer who deposited horses heads in peoples ' beds , has evolved into the kind of archetypal Western figure of unquestioned decency you 'd be happy to trust your life to - even more so when you remember he tried to kill John Wayne in True Grit ! If he shoots someone seemingly out of the blue , you know it 's someone who needs shooting although much of the action takes place offscreen such is his moral stature . By contrast , Church seems uncomfortable and out of place - he does well enough , but they never strike the sparks that made Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones ' relationship in Lonesome Dove so memorable and affecting . And Lonesome Dove does unfortunately cast a giant shadow over this : it may be a smaller story , but , especially after Open Range , you expect more when Duvall gets in the saddle . Despite that , it 's an engaging enough amble and extremely well made . Hill is one of the few working directors who still know the power of an extreme long shot , giving the show an occasional sense of the epic , though this is sometimes undercut by the fact that he generally plays his scenes in medium shots . More focused than his intriguing but scattershot Wild Bill but less impressive than The Long Riders or his under-rated Geronimo : An American Legend , it 's worth a look , but you might just want to spread it over a couple of nights .",m,0
"A very good western , with somewhat of a chick flick imbedded , meaning my wife enjoyed it too .",m,1
This movie looks so good on Blu-ray Disc . The Story is Good ! ! ! So own Broken Trail today .,m,1
"If there are any actors today that can fit into chaffs and cowboy boots , they would be Clint Eastwood & Robert Duvall . Duvall has stated in an interview that of all the roles he has played as a character actor , none fit him better than that of a cowboy . This film is in a sense a continuation of his roles from `` Lonesome Dove '' to `` Open Range '' in which he plays a seasoned cowboy who has to fight the bitter elements , human and natural , in order to get the job done . Duvall is ably supported here by Thomas Haden Church who in a break from his comedic roles , is excellent as his long estranged nephew who joins him on the cattle drive . With excellent direction from long time vet Walter Hill and some fine support from Greta Scacchi as a former prostitute with a yen for Duvall , and James Russo & Chris Mulkey as the villains -- '' Broken Trail '' is a trip you do n't want to end despite its length I saw a pre-screening of it before its showing on AMC with Hill in attendance and was impressed .",m,1
"I absolutely loved this movie . I 'm not a big fan of westerns , but this movie was different . It actually had depth to it and was n't just some gunslinging western . I liked the little romance part and the way things ended between Tom and Sun Foy .",f,1
"Broken Trail : better than Open Range , not quite as good as Lonesome Dove , but all in all , a very satisfying western . If Robert Duval wanted to be judged by any three movies which are quintessentially American , I do n't think he could do better than these . [ After a terribly slow first half , Open Range does speed up and Duval makes the turn very meaningful . ] With large sections of Broken Trail seen through the youg Chinese girls ' eyes and spirits , we get a slightly different view of the Old West than we have perhaps had . And that is a good thing . Church and Duval make a great family pairing . I believed they could be related and Church 's portrayal of the quiet-spoken man of action and principle is spot-on and a far cry from his Cowboy character in Tombstone . Excellent scenery and photography - the cinematographer needs an award for this production as well ; solid , not flashy direction , and a supporting cast that fit smoothly into the story , all make this a movie I bought as soon as it was available . I knew I would buy it after watching the first part on its television debut . The only slightly annoying aspect of the movie experience is the blackouts for the commercial breaks . Other than that , if you like Westerns , as I do , including every 'B ' movie western ever made , you will love Broken Trail .",m,1
"I really enjoyed the entire DVD but being an old time traditionalist , I was not happy with the ending which was just plain depressing . Robert Duvall has now set the standard for resurrecting the old time westerns and proves that there is a demand for good quality movies not depending on sex or excessive violence in order to garner viewers . . . . . . . . . Mr . Duvall has now become one of my favorite actors and joins my other favorite Tom Selleck . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",m,1
This is a movie well worth watching over and over it is a clean exciting movie that leaves you wanting more of the same . < a href= '' http : www . amazon . com gp product B000GFRI4K '' > Broken Trail < a > As always Robert Duvall out does himself once again . A must watch for anyone who loves westerns .,f,1
"This movie was recommended to me by a friend as one I would like being a big Western fan especially of more modern Westerns ! I bought this Blu-Ray with nothing else to go on and it was pretty good . I did n't realize that it is a two disc two-part movie and it is quite long , but despite that it is a good and entertaining story",m,1
"A must see for anyone who enjoys Robert DuVall . Great cast . . . . and oh what a lovely story . Well worth seeing even if you 're not a `` cowboy '' so to speak . So get out the popcorn and watch a spectacular movie , the story line just keeps you right in the movie .",f,1
"Love Robert Duvall and in this movie he is at his best . He looks to be a real horseman as I have known quite a few in my day . Very authentic . Well made movie with beautiful scenery . As a matter of fact , I think we 'll watch it again tonight .",f,1
"Great western , heartwarming , with strong story line and characters . It 's hard to find a western , that 's really good anymore . Thumbs up .",f,1
". . . and you 're likely to have a masterpiece on your hands . That was true of `` Tender Mercies , `` `` Lonesome Dove , `` and `` Open Range , `` and it 's also true of `` Broken Trail , `` Walter Hill 's mesmerizing , exquisitely photographed Western miniseries about a couple of cowboys -- uncle and nephew -- who come to the rescue of five Chinese girls who were sold into prostitution . Duvall 's Print Ritter ca n't help but remind you of `` Lonesome Dove 's '' Gus McCrae or `` Open Range 's '' Boss Spearman , but at the same time Print is very different from Gus or Boss in subtle ways that only a master actor such as Duvall can make clear . `` Broken Trail '' is magnificently acted throughout . Thomas Haden Church forgoes his usual goofy persona as Print 's nephew Tom Harte , in a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a brave , sad cowboy , downtrodden by life yet beholden to no one . Chris Mulkey -- bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late Howard Duff -- is properly loathsome as the outlaw `` Big Ear '' Ed Bywaters , and Greta Scacchi is deeply moving as Nola , a hard-luck woman menaced by Bywaters and enamored of Print . Viewers might complain that the young Chinese women do n't becomne very individualized , but -- given the movie 's realism in showing that the girls ca n't speak English or comprehend Wild West culture -- that was probably inevitable . Alan Geoffrion -- who also wrote the original novel of `` Open Range '' -- provides a screenplay that is n't all happily-ever-after , but is satisfyingly poignant and filled with rich dialogue and characterizations . `` Broken Trail '' is a must-see for Robert Duvall fans and Western fans alike .",m,1
"I fell in love with this movie . The cinematography is beautiful and the setting is idyllic . Robert Duval proved once again what depth he has as an actor . He is a true story teller with his craft . I had n't seen the supporting actor , Thomas Hayden Church in anything other than `` Sideways '' and was skeptical about him pulling off the role of Robert Duval 's nephew . He surprised me with his believable character . The story is truly remarkable when you consider that it is based on real lives . Is that a spoiler ? I highly recommend this movie !",f,1
"This is one of the best Westerns to come out in several years . It reminds me of of some of the older Westerns , great story and great acting . You ca n't beat Robert Duvall , he just makes you believe he 's an old Cowboy . Thomas Haden Church missed his calling , he could have made some good Westerns over the years . The only problem is nobody writes enough good ones these days . Hopefully THC will get that chance to make a few more in his career .",m,1
"This in one of the best westerns of the modern era . I was a stuntman in Hollywood during the 50 's when the western was it 's most popular . I worked on some huge projects but none as good as todays western . Broken Trail in as good as . . . . . or better , then OPEN RANGE , THE UNFORGIVEN or SILVERADO . Duvall is the `` real '' western cowboy . I worked with him on THE PURSUIT OF D . B . COOPER in 1980 and it does n't appear that he has changed hardly at all . I recommend this film and guarantee you will watch it over and over .",m,1
I was introduced to this mini series via the Louis L'Amour discussion forum and buying via amazon let me get the story before it was even considered for distribution in Australasia . The filming and locations for this story are magnificent and this is equalled by the quality of the cast and story line . The use of subtitles and script in mandarin are no hinderance to the story . Can highly recommend the purchase of this DVD,m,1

"After viewing the excellent saga of `` Lonesome Dove '' & `` Streets of Laredo '' I looked forward with anticipation to this Movie of the old west . Especially when it stars Robert Duvall , a most underrated actor . Well I was n't disappointed , it 's a great movie , which puts John Waynes West in a totally different catagary . Another underrated actor in my opinion is James Garner who played Tommy lee Jones part I believe in Streets of Laredo . I must admit though I was not impressed with `` Return to Lonesome Dove '' . also I liked `` Open Range '' All these movie give to me a more accurate idea of what the west was really like",m,1
"Broken Trail is a well produced Duvall film , not avaiable in Australia . Was very pleased to obtain it via Amazon , your service is impeccable .

"This is an amazing story of principles and dedication . The filmography was beautiful . The only thing that was off was it seemed to drag in places and there were those relatively long fade out and ins between scenes . I understand that this film was made to be a mini-series and when someone is watching it over several days or weeks depending on the showing schedule one needs these repetitive shots of a horse drive slowly making its way across the country side to set the scene for each series . No one ever went across the planes with several hundred horses and a wagon full of young girls very quickly . So this is a wonderfully crafted movie asside from the long fade in and outs ; it probably works better on TV over time than on my computer , viewing it at one sitting . One more little thing about the script . Why did it say there were 500 horses when they only used about 100 or so to do the film ? It would have been OK to just say 200 and it would have been just as impressive . Still , it was a beautiful film !",f,1
"This was a good movie , all 3 hours of it . I would highly recommend it to any western fan .",f,1
Very good -- never saw it when it first came out -- do n't know how I missed it .,f,1
"Beginning with his role as Augustes McCrae in Lonesome Dove 1989 , Robert Duvall has carved out his place in western cinimatic history as the Ultimate American Cowboy . This is not to be confused with the great personae that a certain Mr . Eastwood , among others , has created during his remarkable film career . We 're not talking about the `` man with no name '' that is today 's hero , but rather the real cowboy that would also have been revered in his own time . In Broken Trail , Robert Duvall continues his portrayal of the sage old cowboy who is frought with human frailties , yet hard-edged enough to survive the dangers of his period . Just watch for Duvall 's mouth movements such as spitting , chewing or the one-handed smoothing his mustache with a bit of saliva . He is THE GREAT AMERICAN COWBOY and this wonderfully crafted western should be watched just for Robert Duvall 's presence .",m,1
"I acted in this movie , so I am alittle biased , but it was not what I had thought , more drama , less action , but a good movie all the same",m,1
"I would compare this movie to BBC Planet Earth . Both films are great , have a lot of amazing shots and a few not so amazing . My machine plays this movie at about half of computing power , electricity is filtered , HDTV used as monitor calibrated with Spider2Express . This Blu-ray release is not as good as 3:10 To Yuma . I would still recommend this purchase .",m,1

the usual solid robert duvall performance in lonesome dove mode but stillworth veiwing . my wife usually not a western fan enjoyed the film,m,0
"My ex-wife turned-me-on to Westerns , which were not high on my hit list before giving-in to her , Yes , I was a easy mark for a sweet voice and and a pretty face , unfortunately it was n't hers and she ditched me when I remembered who 's it was that raced my heart ! Tami , if you ever read this I am sorry for any embarassment it brings you , you know it 's All true , so do n't damn me , please ? Anyway , once I made the conversion from Comedy to Western , I found Robert Duvall to be the epiome of a Western Hero . Perhaps who Willie Nelson was thinking of when he wrote M Heros Have Always Been Cowboys This is one of Duvall 's finest , watch it , enjoy it and never forge Tami , I wo n't !",m,1
The movie was for my grandmother for Christmas . She loved it . . . . . . into Westerns .,f,1
I anticipated a great movie because Robert Duvall is in it . After seeing Open Range I was ready for another great western . I was really enjoying the movie until it just up and ended after the girls were being rescued again . There they are fleeing town and the credits start rolling . Talk about being ripped .,m,0
An interesting western but filled with nudity and actions that bring the quality of he movie down . The acting was less than smooth . Two cowboys save five chinese girls and have to take them cross country with them on their cattle drive . I ca n't recommend this movie to any one .,f,0
"First , let me say the actors and production crew on BROKEN TRAIL do an admirable job on this film . Everyone , and I mean EVERYONE does an outstanding job in bringing this film to the screen . But Canada , was chosen , rather than the USA , for actors , production crew and location . These production companies generate alot of money to the local economy . But the locales of the story are supposed to be Oregon and Wyoming . Why was a foreign country chosen instead ? Is this because locations and talent were not available or suitable in Oregon or Wyoming ? No . Were it that simple . It 's because of greed . Because of taxes and other incentives , many American directors and producers work in Canada because it 's cheaper . Duvall , who is `` Executive Producer '' and director Walter Hill , felt they could do it cheaper and better outside the USA to make more profits and work with the people they 've done so on so many other films shot in Canada . How much money do these guys need ! ! ! ! ? I 'm surprised at Duvall as he is so pro-american being a staunch Republican . Wake up everybody . We are losing so much of America including even the western through more `` outsourcing '' and what Duvall proudly calls `` our greatest American heritage '' .",m,0
"`` Broken Trail '' , a dream project for producer star Robert Duvall , and AMC 's first original film , is the spiritual heir to Kevin Costner 's 2003 `` Open Range '' also starring Duvall , and one of the most moving , involving Westerns of recent years . With a charismatic , extremely effective performance by Thomas Haden Church , as Duvall 's long-estranged nephew , the film is one of only a handful of Westerns that combine epic sweep , superb characterization , and an understanding of the 'Real West ' , without shortchanging decency , or respect of an individual 's worth . The era was hard , justice could be swift and brutal , and Duvall , as aging but upright Prentice Ritter , lives by his own rules ; to protect the helpless in his care , to respect others , and to be unafraid to resort to violence , if necessary . Tom Harte Church , despite some family history problems with his uncle , lives by the same code , and the two men , driving a herd of horses from Oregon to Wyoming to raise cash for a ranch , become the 'saviors ' of five young Chinese women , sold into prostitution , who inadvertently fall into their hands . These are good men , in a jaded world , and their journey picks up other 'strays ' , as well as the women ; young Virginian fiddler Heck Gilpin an engaging Scott Cooper , is rescued by Tom in a saloon ; aging Chinese laborer Lung Hay Donald Fong , and careworn prostitute Nola John the wonderful Greta Scacchi join the group after Tom saves the Chinese women from rapists , in a boarding house bordello . While neither Ritter and Harte were overjoyed at the strange direction the drive was taking , they would not allow harm to fall on 'innocents ' , and the group bonds into a warm 'family ' , with Nola and Ritter finding a mature attraction between each other , and Tom and Sun Foy # 3 Gwendoline Yeo , who speaks only Mandarin , in the film , gently falling in love . Danger is never far behind them , however , as brutal ex-con 'Big Ears ' Chris Mulkey , with a score to settle with Nola , and a 'contract ' to return the Chinese women to whorehouse owner Kate 'Big Rump ' Becker Rusty Schwimmer , trails them , leading a gang of killers . . . While the film is long 240 minutes , director Walter Hill , an old hand at Westerns his `` The Long Riders '' is one of my favorites , keeps the story constantly engrossing , and Duvall and Church have a warmth and authenticity as the characters that will stay with you , long after the movie ends . Shot in the Canadian Rockies , `` Broken Trail '' combines grandeur and intimacy seamlessly , has moments of great humor to lighten the drama , explosive action , and a bittersweet sense of nostalgia . . . It is , simply , superb !",m,1
"I can only hope they someone keeps making Westerns because the few that have been made the last few years have been outstanding . This one , a TV miniseries , is just great . I ca n't say enough good things about it . I saw it recently on DVD . It was a three-hour film . I thought I read somewhere that it was four hours , so I do n't know if this version has been cut down . I only know what I saw , and I liked about everything I saw . I also knew what to expect . . . . . and that helped . I did n't expect a rough film with a ton of violence and nasty characters , language , etc . What surprised me was just how interesting a film this was for being three hours long and not having a lot of action . I attribute this to the dialog , the acting , characters you care about and the wonderful cinematography . It 's hard to beat the scenery in a nicely-filmed western . The words coming out of the two stars of the picture , Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church were extremely believable material . These guys were tough , but not abrasively- macho , compassionate but not sappy . As `` Prentice Ritter '' and `` Tom Harte , `` respectively , they fascinating to watch . I liked what they said throughout the movie and they were extremely believable characters . They looked and talked the part . This story is different because it 's mainly about helping five young Chinese women , who are destined for prostitution , slavery and who knows what else . Ritter and Harte did n't volunteer for the job ; it accidentally came upon them as they were escorting horses North for a nice payday . The two men showed wonderful compassion for these girls , despite the fact they slowed their mission down and had a problem with communication . It simple terms : this is a nice movie , a good story about good guys doing a good deed for the right reasons . Watching them do it , under adverse conditions , was almost a privilege . A big thank you to all involved with this movie and giving us fans of this genre hope that it is n't completely dead .",m,1
"Duvall is the rough around the edges , but loving grandfather-like figure you know had to exist back in those wild times of the old west . This is the 3rd and probably last western for Duvall , who has stated that Broken Trail completes his trilogy with Lonesome Dove and Open Range . Church is a tough , determined , western man who does things `` the cowboy way '' . . . he 's perfect for the part , and you 'll agree once you see him and his character . What the story lacks in action-adventure , it sure makes up for in character development , relationships , scenery , and just plain pulling you in , and making you feel like you 're actually on the horse-drive with them . And when the action does come , it 's shocking , tense , and more realistic than any western before . this movie about good honest men , doing the right thing , in a time and place where no one else did . This movie is n't just for western fans or men , but women can really get into this , as there are several female co-stars here who wrestle with the hardships of the day as seen from the eyes of a woman in the late 1800s , in the lawless west . I 've read it before on a review forum , and I agree that on a top ten list , if Lonesome Dove is a 10 , and Open Range is a 9 , then Broken Trail is an 8 or 8 & 1 2 ! ! ! I ca n't wait for this release .",m,1
"A friend loaned me this little gem when she came home after holidaying in the U . S . A . If you enjoyed Lonesome Dove and Open Range you will enjoy Broken Trail and , YES , Mr Duval does his : Gus Mcrae : again . SO WHAT ? It , s not as if it is a bad performance and it fits in with the pace of the film and the storyline . In reviewing a film i dont believe you should say a lot about the story as it could give people a pre-conceived idea about whats going to happen . Let them judge for themselves . Broken Trail is an easy , gentle , with some real dark moments , Western , with an unusual story , and some great performances particularly from Mr Church . Considering that most people would find it hard to imagine him in a western , he was excellent and portrayed a great , strong , silent , hero . Get the kids to bed , feet up and enjoy this Western . Davy , wesnut .",m,1
"For those of you who are big fans of the TV mini-series , Lonesome Dove , and the Kevin Costner movie , Open Range , here 's another one to wet your appetite with -- Broken Trail , starring the great Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church . It was only by accident I was watching the Hollywood Foreign Press Awards show a few months ago and Duvall was nominated for his role in Broken Trail that I found out about this three-hour mini-series made specifically for the American Movie Channel in 2006 . And , once I found out about it , I discovered that the mini-series was already out on DVD . Miracles do occasionally happen ! Anyway , Broken Trail is the story of Print Ritter played by Duvall who inherits his sister 's farm after she dies . Her son , Tom Harte played by Church , is left nothing because he took it upon himself to strike out on his own years earlier . Ritter meets with Harte and explains what has happen , suggesting that maybe the both of them could join together and lead a herd of 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming . Since Harte has nothing to lose , he agrees to help his uncle for twenty-five percent of the profits . In their journey across the north-western part of the country , they pick-up a Virginian gentleman fiddler named Heck Gilpin played by Scott Cooper , five abused and abandoned Chinese women who 'd been sold into a life of slavery , a prostitute with a broken nose who 's played by Greta Scacchi , and an old Chinese man played by Donald Wong . To make matters even more complicated , they 're being followed by a group of killers , led by Big Ears played by Chris Mulkey , and there will be a final showdown . Broken Trail delivers in full force with the majestic scenery of the northwest , a story of goodness battling evil with the killing fast and violent , the superb acting of both Robert Duvall and Thomas Hayden Church not to mention the rest of the cast , especially Chris Mulkey as the villain who never raises his voice , yet manages to project a true sense of evil , the eye for detail and accuracy about the Old West , and the excellent direction of Walter Hill . This is the kind of Western that you 'll want to watch over and over again with Robert Duvall playing the type of role that he was born for . The DVD extras include a twenty-minute featurette on the Making of Broken Trail . Thank God for DVDs . Now , when a truly excellent movie like Broken Trail appears on a TV station that you do n't get , all you have to do is wait for the DVD to come out . Highly recommended !",m,1
"Robert Duvall reprises his aging cowboy roles from `` Lonesome Dove '' and `` Open Range '' in this 3-hour TV western that follows not a cattle drive but the cross-country trek of a herd of mustangs from Oregon to Wyoming in the closing years of the 19th century . Many of the elements of the genre are here , including the beauty and wide-open spaces of the western landscape the film was shot in Alberta , Canada , the presence of vicious outlaws threatening the lives and welfare of the film 's heroes , much gunplay , conflicts with Indians , and the vulnerability of women in a lawless land . In this case , there is the added element of a little-known fact of western history , the presence of Asian immigrants and the not uncommon fate of many Chinese women sold into lives of prostitution . As some other reviewers have already noted here , the film runs a bit long . While it attempts to provide a history lesson in American diversity and prejudice , the script tends to shy away from providing much depth . It 's treatment of some themes is glancing and at times predictable . And one could also argue that an important social problem is played more for entertainment value than thought-provoking illumination . While Duvall is unbeatable in this kind of role , with the wisdom of years , a salty edge , and a self-deprecating sense of humor , the performance of Tom Haden Church helps hold the film together from start to finish . Skeptical , a bit soured by his bachelor cowboy life , and rarely smiling , he remains a wonderful foil to the older Duvall . And he gets the best line of the movie . When a madam objects to his rescue of the five Chinese girls by shouting , `` Those girls are my property , `` he replies , `` That 's the price of capitalism . `` The set designer for `` Deadwood '' has created a wild , woolly frontier town , and we 're reminded in scene after scene that the West was unpaved . There is mud to be found almost everywhere there are people , cattle , and horses . A making-of featurette has informative interviews with many of those both in front of and behind the cameras . Not a really great film , but worth watching whether you like westerns or not .",m,1
"I LOVE this movie . It is probably one of the best cowboy movies made in the last 10 years and is based on a true story which is even better in my opinion . The only problem with this movie is that since it was a mini series the movie `` ends '' halfway and the credits roll . If I had never seen it I might have thought it just ended badly and never seen the end . Why did n't they take out the credits and just recorded it as one movie as is done with so many mini-series put in DVD ? Never the less , I highly recommend this movie ! ! !",f,1
"The scenery makes it worth the upgrade to Blu-ray . Add that to a great plot , great cinematography , and award-winning acting , you get a movie that you might put in your personal 'top ten ' list . Yep , it 's that good .",m,1
This movie was like old time hollywood . Then they had class . Today mostly junk . I loved this movie . Robert Duvall and all were marvelous and as I watched this movie I was entranced . Why did this not win an award ? Stupid hollywood . I hope more quality movies TV or other will be made . But I doubt it . Hooray for Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church .,f,1
"Honestly , Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make this a four-star movie . It 's a classic western story , with clearly defined good guys and bad guys . The character interaction is top-notch . There 's no multi-million dollar special effects , but the acting by all is rock solid . Print Ritter Duvall and Tom Harte Tomas Haden Church unexpectedly become the guardians of five abused and abandoned Chinese girls in the midst of their horse drive .",m,1
"FINALLY ! ! ! I love American Westerns . I love US History , Native Americans , horses and adventures . I grew up thinking `` Why ca n't Chinese people have significant leading roles in the Westerns ? `` Were we not a part of the American history ? ? ? Railroad anyone ? California Gold Rush ? This is better than my wildest dreams ! 5 Chinese girls in leading , respectable , roles in a Western ! ! ! I am so happy ! Thomas Haden Church is so hot because of this role ! Everyone ! ! ! Go watch it !",f,1
"Both Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church excel and head a marvelous cast in this gripping western that is filled with amazingly beautiful images of the American Northwest . About 3 hours long , but it seems much less . I wanted it to go on and on . Two men with a plan for the future discover just how many curves fate can throw in their direction , and they adapt wonderfully . This is a western that your wife will enjoy as well as yourself ; sometimes the heartstrings are being pulled as well as the triggers . The images on Blu-Ray are outstanding .",m,1
This is one of the most beautifully filmed and moving stories of all time . Blu-ray only makes it even more beautiful to behold . Both Duvall and Church are superb in their portrayals of cowboys with hearts . This BD belongs in every man 's library .,m,1
"The film opens in Chinatown San Francisco , 1898 where we five exotic virgins from the Celestial Empire are bought by Captain Billy Fender James Russo to be sold as slaves and introduced into the brief and violent life of prostitution . . . Robert Duvall stars as `` Print '' Ritter , an old cowhand whose sister left a will inheriting all to him rather than to her own son , Tom Harte Thomas Haden Church who lives in John Day Country Oregon . . . Print ignores why she has done it , or why was crossed between the two , but his sister done it . . . Print got the idea to buy a team of tough , high-desert mustangs -- three to eight years of age -- to take them to Sheridan , Wyoming to sell to the British Empire ; the money they 'll earn will be to increase their capital . . . And on the shares , Print figures a 25-75 split on profits after expenses and loan repayment to the bank . . . From this point , Hill 's Western becomes a road movie , with all kinds of odd characters , from ugly villains to a friendly musician , but the key to `` Broken Trail '' is that through a series of circumstances , fate has placed the five Chinese innocent girls in the hands of Tom and his uncle . . . But the reality is another . . . Their families sold them to that rat captain heading out to the mining camp , where Kate , an odious saloon owner , bought them from an associate in San Francisco . . . Our two cowboys save the girls ' lives from rape and take them along on their journey . . . With great photography , gorgeous vistas , perilous ground , sensible brave girls , good and decidedly courageous men , great action when it is necessary , and a big confrontation at the climax of the movie , Hill 's Western is a must see film for the fans of the genre . . .",m,1
"I am a real western fan and I loved this movie . It is more family oriented than most and Robert Duval does a wonderful job as usual , acting as a `` good man '' when it comes to all these women he seemingly inherits . He does the right thing , all the way through . Recommended ! !",f,1
This movie is terrific . A stark look into the old west and how the bad people treated the less fortunate and the good people who had higher moral values . Great job by Robert Duvall and Tom Church .,f,1
"I love westerns , and this one ranks as one of the greatest of all times . Much superior to the over-rated Lonesome Dove . If I could give this 10 stars , I would ! !",m,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed watching `Broken Trail ' and after viewing westerns for over five decades I would now rank this movie as my favourite . It is superb in all respects . The landscapes are spectacular , the acting brilliant , the action at times breathtaking and a storyline that readily elicits , in the viewer , a full range of emotions . The Blu-ray version does great justice to the movie . The colour , the sound and the sharpness of each frame make this movie a true high definition experience . The credits at the end of the movie indicated that the story was based on true events and this surprise , without forewarning , acted like the icing on an already delicious slice of cake . It 's a movie that I will watch over and over again .",m,1
"Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church make an excellent combination in this Old West seting . Great story line with excellent acting . If you like westerns , you will love this .",m,1
I never get tried of watching Robert Duvall movies . His sense of fairness and compassion comes across in every part he plays . Thomas Haden Chruch 's performance in this movie made me like him a little more .,f,1
"I have been buying from Amazon now for 2 years and they have never been late on a promised delivery time . Now that I am buying Blu-Ray DVDs , Amazon is the only way to go . If you buy 3 , you can save enough on one movie to pay to for shipping , so you get 3 for the price of 2 at Wal-Mart or Best Buy . Also , you ca n't find this title locally . This is a under-rated gem of a film . Reference quality transfer with just a few specks . 9 out of a 10 . Very good picture quality , even in the low light and night shots . Excellent story and character development . Audio does n't use the rear surround speakers much though , about the only knock against this film . Audio on the front is very good with dialog always easy to hear . This is a definite buy on Blu-Ray if you like westerns .",m,1
"Great Western , highly recommend . Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church both did a great job with this movie . It had a nice switch with it dealing with them driving horses and come across 5 Chinese girls that they save from being sold into prostitution and many adventures along the journey .",m,1
"After all the westerns ever made , you 'd think that they 'd run out of good ideas after a while . But `` Broken Trail '' proves that there is still life , and fresh blood , to be seen in THE American film genre . The three-hour film finds an uncle and nephew running a herd of horses to Wyoming , and unexpectedly become guardians of five Oriental women meant to become prostitutes . The journey that they all take together is a truly fascinating one , which has never been covered in this genre before . While the storytelling and cinematography are great , the two highlights are the casting and the music . Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church are fantastic as the two male leads , and well-deserved the Emmys they won for their roles . The strong supporting cast , of which there are too many to name here , do fantastic as well . The score by David Mansfield and Van Dyke Parks is truly memorable , and adds to the strengths of this epic piece . As a fan of the western , I truly enjoyed `` Broken Trail . `` If you enjoy this genre , and the acting talents of Duvall and Haden Church , then you 'll enjoy it as well . Movie DVD Grade : A",m,1
This is a great move . It is an honest rendention of life during this time frame . The charactors are not heros but down to earth people doing what they know is right and just . I highly recommend this move for all family members to watch together .,m,1
"A really enjoyable movie in the same vein as Lonesome Dove , great outdors effects and stunning scenery , the acting is first class , excellent story line , very authentic attention to detail , and to cap it all off an outstanding performance from Robert Duval and all the actors in the movie . All the ingrients of a first class western , certainly gets my vote .",m,1
"Robert Duvall can gallop into a western without much in the way of preparation , such is his natural affinity for the genre . Not surprisingly , he delivers yet another convincing and satisfying performance as the uncle who inherits his sister 's estate and then strikes a deal with his nephew to set things right . It 's not the typical conflict of western epics , but good enough to set the story in motion and bring it to an odd but worthy conclusion . Thomas Haden Church as the rejected son is the real surprise in Broken Trail . While his character is low key , the honesty and humor Church delivers is far from it . In every scene he persuasively portrays a man who responds to his situation with quiet strength and pragmatic acceptance of the outcome . Beyond stellar performances , the film offers great production which includes beautiful scenery and attention to detail . There are moments when the story seems to noticably slow down , but this strikes me as purposeful . The scenes in between story movement are what give it depth , and contrast the ugliness of human subjugation with the gorgeous landscape in which it takes place . This is a rare film that stands up to many repeated viewings without ever becoming stale .",m,1
"I have n't seen this DVD , but I saw the mini-series when it was broadcast and agree with all the positive comments -- including that it is better than the more famous Lonesome Dove . One thing I have n't seen mentioned here is that it gets my vote in Movie FanFare 's recent `` What 's the all-time best movie shootout ? `` poll . I hit rewind on my DVR about four times just for the pleasure of watching the shootout sequence over again -- by itself that sequence elevates this to Western Classic status . Splendidly done !",f,1
"I love Robert Duvall , and believe that the only actor who does cowboys better is John Wayne - but that is probably generational . This is a two bags of popcorn movie .",m,1
"Just finished watching this superb movie last night , and like a kid , I 'm tempted to watch it again ! But I 'll wait- so that I can enjoy it more , since I 'm not a kid ! This is a great adventure in the `` real '' , earthy , tough , no-holds-barred , sometimes bloody way , not unlike `` The Culpepper Cattle Co . `` , another great fairly recent depiction of the Wild West . In my opinion , this is far more enjoyable than movies like `` Unforgiven '' and `` The Wild Bunch '' for it 's story . The story is touching , exciting , suspenseful , and sometimes humourous- in other words , everything you would expect from a great movie ! And , it certainly helps to have fine acting , great cinematography , sound , and amazingly beautiful scenery . I 'll not try to tell the story- I 'm sure other reviewers have . But I think you 'll enjoy this movie even more if you stop reading reviews all the way that attempt to describe the entire movie from start to finish , even giving away the ending ! Why the hell do people do that , anyway ? ! Anyway , for a special treat , if you 're in to the occasional `` marathon '' type movie night , try watching this back to back with `` The Culpepper Cattle Co . `` Either way , enjoy !",m,1

"Just as art is eye-catching , and models are the objects of art , `` Bellissima '' captures beauty in multiple ways . The story is incredible , the music is very fitting , and the film as a whole is exceptional cinematography . The film is about a mother that wants her daughter to excel as a model . The mother 's life revolves around the success of her daughter . The daughter , however , is not entirely thrilled with the idea and her mother 's determination . Several events come full circle , leaving one with a sense of irony about their lives and the twists of fate . `` Bellissima '' is a quick watch , and never boring You are bound to feel sympathetic for the daughter as her life takes several unexpected turns . `` Bellissima '' is emotional at times and perfect for those who enjoy dramatic films .",m,1
"A humble and discretely poor woman , starred by my beloved Italian Actress in any age : Anna Magnani , will make the best she can for her daughter wins in this attractive competition .

"I had a lot of high hopes going into the theater for this movie . It exceeded those hopes in a glorious fashion . I loved the original , the sotry , the art , everything . So when I heard that Bloodlust was being played real close to my work I went to see it . Amazing . I am a true believer that the original is always the best , but this blew the original right out of the water . The art form , the story which was great because , I was wondering where the bloodlust was coming from , and when that was revealed the true nature of the story came in . < p > Excellent anime . I will definitely be seeing again in the next couple of days . And , when I hear that it will be coming to DVD I will have my pre-order set .",m,1
"Ok I just have to say this . My and my friend , we watched this movie with the sound off . And you know what ? It was still very enjoyable . This movie is all about the art . The story is merely an excuse to have a dark , very badass anti-hero walk around acting like a badass in a visually interesting and pleasing environment . I did n't know until after I rented this movie that it only comes dubbed in English , and it really threw me off . I HATE dudding . . . which is why I had the sound off . The dubbing on this is about as good as can be expected , although of lesser quality than Princess MOnonoke or Akira . The dialogue is terrible and a bit confusing at times , and the plot . . . well the plot is basic and not terribly important . Rent this movie if you want to look at something pretty and nicely animated .",m,0
"From the moment I saw buff guys with big weapons riding around in a modified tank , I knew this would be different from the original . The entire world seems to work on different principles less gritty magic , more gritty machines , and it comes across quite clearly in this radically different anime style . Fans of the & quot ; X & quot ; feature will enjoy it , but others will wonder why so many heads look like triangles with *gasp* huge eyes . < p > But the thing that got me to watch the original was interesting violence , and you 've got some here . Unicycle-riding midgets , werewolves with giant fangs in their abdomen , terminally ill patients shooting up to turn into psychic juggernauts , and the voice of Starscream ! Some of this does seem like the product of a bad drug trip , but it is well-rendered and imaginative . < p > The parasitic & quot ; but I 've always been a good parasite , & quot ; hand returns with a bit of sarcastic wit this time , providing the much-needed dialogue and exposition D is incapable of delivering . Still , D seems a bit loose-tongued in comparison to his last appearance in 1985 . His voice is well casted as a matter of opinion , most of these voices are great , but there are times when I sat up in the theatre puzzled , because D just would n't say this or that . Still , he delivers the righteous justice and unrelenting effort of any good , sword-wielding anime protagonist . < p > The protagonist complex of so many characters is interesting , because many come across as genuinely good main characters , almost competing for screen time . Some stories are intense enough to push D off altogether , but not for too long . He is never five minutes away from a fight scene . However , the antagonist complex of so many characters everybody seems to hate everybody that they are n't sleeping with or being paid millions to save gets a little thin . Carmilla , who could be considered the principle villainess , does n't even get mentioned in the first sixty minutes of the movie . < p > All in all , there are compelling , intertwining motivations , and enough eye candy to keep the average fan of anime through a sitting , but the ending is cliche are n't all the best ones ? , and other than to catch a few fight scenes over again , I did n't see much rewatch value . But if you can , see this in the theatre . Some of the visuals , and all of the sounds , deserve it .",m,1
"The original D was a tour de force , such an original take on vampire hunters that anyone who saw the movie remembered it decades later . Now D is back and even tougher than before . The animation is simply amazing . The crumbling crosses in the beginning really set the mood of evil and terror . What starts out as a kidnapping turns out to be oh so much more . The plot develops smoothly , giving little away beforehand . Soon you 'll find yourself conflicted , then cheering for the vampire that D is hunting . The end is another totally new twist that M . Night could learn a thing or two from . The villains , merging of vampire magic and technology , and D - all combine for another fantastic to this Dystopian far future where vampires rule the night , and D brings justice with a sword . And this face thing in his palm .",m,1
"It 's an awesome movie . If you like anime , or just animation in general you 'll enjoy this movie . Its an awesome movie and an instant cult classic .",m,1
"D is back and is already on is way to [ stardom ] . If you have saw the first series you will love this film , it has all that makes an anime brilliant . Re vamped animation and fight scenes that will make you 're pet monkey crall to the corner of the room . < p > In other words this is a must see anime .",m,1
"To sum the movie up in two words : Nothing Better ! The animation is spectacular , the storyline not hard to understand , and the characters are just perfect . For those of you who want a movie that will fill that empty spot for action buy it now , you wo n't regret it .",m,1
A nice sequel for an all time classic anime . Brilliant animation with a great storyline make this an awesome anime altogether . All anime fans owe it to themselves to get this now .,m,1
"This has to be the best anime and best vampire movie I have ever seen . PERIOD ! ! First off , the animation is just out of this world , it is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I 've seen except maybe Ghost in the Shell . It was just so crisp and clean . Second , I have never seen a movie where the music just fit so perfectly . I literally had goose bumps at some parts . Third , the story is great . Now like others have said it does have a few parts that you sorta have to quess on what 's happened or how it 's happening but it 's nothing too major . Fouth , The characters are just great and have real personaltiys and their not just cookie cutter . Now on some of the other reviews people have said how they prefer the japanese voices and that they were dissapointed that they are n't in the movie . Well guys I hate to break it to you but there are n't any japanese voices . The voices for the characters were all done here in the states and the movie was never done in japanese that is why you ca n't have japanese dubbing . I personally do n't think the voices could have been done better , they just fit every chracter . So all of you that do n't own this movie go out and buy it right now ! ! ! ! !",m,1
"Before I go on about how great this movie is , let me just take a second to point out a few of the things less than perfect that appear in the film . OK , there English dubbing tend to get a bit annoying at times the female bounty hunter mainly and since this was actually produced in the US , there 's no Japanese dubbing at all . That female bounty hunter that I just mention was often painful to watch and her reason for becoming a hunter was just a total cliche . That , coupled with D , a cool character maybe a bit too much of the stereotypical loner protagonist , almost made parts of the film almost comical . That said , the movie as a whole was just awesome . A pretty damn innovative story although one of the bad guys was obviously `` borrowed '' from Ninja Scroll '' with some of the most beautiful animation seen anywhere . It really was a thrill ride that seemed to be both cutting edge and reminscent of some of the cool , early mid 80s anime . Really cool stuff . If you dug the first D movie , Ninja Scroll , Mononoke or any action oriented anime , or have yet to see any Japanese animation , pick this one up .",m,1
"This movie is one of the best animes I 've seen in a while . It has absolutely stunning visuals . The plot is a little complex , but not so much as to be confusing like many other japanese movies . The character development did leave a bit to be desired , but they did craft a plot with a few more subtleties than the first Vampire Hunter D movie . Voice acting is top notch and , for those of you who seem a little confused , the movie was only recorded with an english voice track . Much like parts of Blood : The Last Vampire Never heard why , but I do n't mind so long as it is well done .",m,1
"First off , this movie was created with english voice actors . This movie was not originally dubbed in japanese . When the movie was premiered in Japan , they watched with Japanese subtitles . Now after clarifying that , I 'd like to say that I was so impressed with this movie . I loved the original Vampire Hunter D movie and I felt this was a huge step up . Both movies are classics for there time . The first is not as impressive artistically yet can still be appreciated and even praised for being so much fun now . But Bloodlust blew me away with beautiful artwork , amazing landscapes , and very creative characters and monsters . The voice talent was also impressive and the storyline , yet thin was very gripping . I also felt that the way this movie was compiled , reminded me of Ninja Scroll . So if you were a fan of Ninja Scroll , give Bloodlust a shot , or vice versa . Enjoy .",f,1
I can only sum up this movie in one word . . . WOW,m,1
"Vampires , Futuristic weapons , love , war , Good , Evil . . . . This DVD has it ALL ! Storyline is excellent and original . Brings an interesting twist to the vampire legend ! A+++++++++ in my book !",m,1
"With D , the character of renowned anime status from the original Vampire Hunter D film , ans his symbiotic hand , this was an excellent experience in the theatre . The art is incredible , and the story unique , as well as having the gothic-tech feel of the original . This was , in my opinion as good or better than the original movie , I recommend it highly to all anime fans .",m,1
"I actually had to order this movie overseas from one of the Asian market stores so I could get a subbed audio version rather then this awful atrocious dubbed version we 're forced to hear . The animation is incredible and the overall story fits with the movie just like the first movie , but if you 're expecting more new age fight scenes like with Trinity Blood or Hellsing you 're going to be disappointed then . Again though I 'd advise trying to get the subbed version of this movie as the terrible acting and awful timing of the dialogue just makes you wince sadly this happens primarily with the main cast characters which really hurts the enjoyment value of the movie even more Comes as no surprise we have n't heard any of the actors actresses on anymore anime movies or series luckily .",m,0
A much improved story and the anime was far superior to it 's predecessor `` Vampire D '' . A very enjoyable feature and worth watching .,m,1
"If you are into anime and vampires than Bloodlust is a MUST HAVE . This is something you will want to watch over and over again . This is a movie you do n't want to end . *slight spoiler warning*Unlike in other vampire movies , this one has a twist . The vampire that steals the girl actually loves her . ****The action , the passion , the comedy . It is all there ; Bloodlust has the whole package . You will not be disapointed . If I had to criticise the movie it would be that there is no part two or that it is not twice as long . Seriously , this movie is that good . I 'll be buying another since I lost the last one I had .",m,1
"No one can deny that the animation in this movie is gorgeous , stunning , beautiful . Characters all have depth to their faces , fluidity to their movies , while still being realistic moving , which is hard to do in animation . While some disagree , the dubbing really is n't bad at all , it even borderlines on good , as do the actors chosen to lend their voices to the parts . However , I 'm not the first to say that the connection between Charlotte and Link was , well , silly at best . Charlotte comes off as being stupid and Link comes off as being an uptight psycho-possesive boyfriend . D was the best in this movie . People complain he did n't have enough depth , well , he 's gon na be around for a while . I doubt that he has any desire just to pop out and fall in love , become someone 's best friend , save a puppy , etc . He was stunningly animated . Maybe that 's just my love for D . Overall , if one could combine the beautiful animation of this one with the storyline of the original , it 'd be the classic anime , the touchstone for all anime to come . This is worth buying , I believe .",f,1
"Before going deep on this review something must be made clear as there are lots of reviews that are not being acurate on this point : Vampire hunter D : Bloodlust original soundtrack IS the english version . A joint-venture between a US company Urban Vision and japanese producers , all lips are synched to the english soundtrack that is available on this disc , even the japanese trailer has subtitles , just like the theatrical run did on Japan . Later they made a japanese audio track , but as that is a DUB , I really do n't care for it shame on you if your reasoning for the whole dub sub argument went down with this one . < p > The first Vampire Hunter D animation , an OVA released on 1985 in Japan and later in the US also available on DVD became an instant classic among fans , and years later it was still ranking high with fans , a cult second to Akira . < p > While not exactly a sequel and you ca n't really tell if this is AFTER or BEFORE the original OVA , this moviei s another story on D 's life , a hunt after another vampire . But this is just the excuse to explore two aspects of the vampires : the forbidden love between a vampire and a human , and the question on how eternal life would affect you something dealt on the first one . < p > Animation is just great , blending computer graphics and traditional animation to create a dark and richly detailed world . Sound effectsare on their right place and the musical score is great , adding depth to the characters and the situation they face . As any anamorphic DVD , video is just great althought it is a bit grainy , more to give more of a film look , as details are really sharp on this one . < p > Bloodlust may not be an anime for everyone , as it is got more depth than the average releases out there , but it is an easy to follow and entertaining movie , an instant classic just as it 's predecessor .",m,1
"This is the best follow-up I 've ever seen ! As a sequel it stands alone . On it 's own it can hold without the previous movie . Originally I was under the impression this was set before the last movie . After seeing I understand how people can get the misconception . The imagery is exquisite and the characters are real . You have to appreciate the way anime does n't WASTE time with cheap songs to sell their art . . . I 'm not jaded because of anime , it 's the facts ! If you love animation done right you 'd never watch another Disney cartoon again . This might make you change your mind like I did , long ago .",m,1
"I just saw the movie today in Austin . I am here to tell you this : I waited two years to see this movie pathtic no ? and it was worth the wait . Everything meshed well together . My only complaint is unlike most reviewers it could have been longer . Espeaiclly when Carmila gets in to the story . That went a too qucikly , but utterwise go see this movie .",m,1
OK NOW I'AM ONLY 13 BUT THIS MOVIE KINKS SO MUCH A** THAT YOU WILL CREAM YOUR PANTS . NOW I KNOW THAT IT IS AN ANIME BUT IT KICKS SO MUCH IT 'S MORE OR LESS A 2 ONE THE FIRST ONE WAS OK IT WAS NOT THE BEST BUT FOR IT 'S TIME I GIVE IT PROPS . BUT IN THIS ONE THE VAMPS TRY TO KILL THE VAMP HUNTER . PLUS THERE IS A LITTLE BACK SIDE OF A WOMEN SHOWING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY ALRIGHT . SO IN ALL ONISTY I RECOMAND THIS DVD IF YOU LIKE VAMP MOVIES .,m,1
"What 's hot : -It 's a bloody mess-It has some serious . . . < p > What 's not : -Some of the characters are just plain stupid yes , you Leila -A couple of ironic twists < p > What 's strange : -Why do n't they put some . . . in this instead of extreme emotional love . < p > What 's the final word : This is among the bloodiest movies on Earth . Once you watch it , it may make you throw up .",m,1
"This movie flat out rocks . Tons of evil characters and heroes that have their own unique special abilities . Almost identical to ninja scroll , but in the Vampire Hunter D universe . Buckets of blood to go along with stunning animation . . . This is what anime was made to do !",m,1
"I loved the first `` Vampire Hunter D . `` I 'm not a fan of the anime genre , but that movie stood as a good movie on its own merits . The hero was noble . The damsel was capable of kicking some mutant tush . And the villain was undeniably EVIL . < p > Most of what I loved about the first movie is missing from this one . D does n't seem as noble a character as he did before though some virtue does shine through . The damsel here is a lovesick puppy who is smitten with the vampire who kidnapped her . And we do n't really even know who the real villain is until the end of the movie . Granted , this last point can make for a good plot , but there was n't enough forshadowing to really make this work . The villain is n't even mentioned until within the last half-hour of the film . < p > The new voice that they got for his hand was a HORRIBLE CHOICE , by the way . < p > The good points of the movie include the awesome musical score and the animation , which is mixed with good computer animation that almost makes some backgrounds look real . I have heard that this movie was actually made in the U . S . , making a literal subtitle translation unnecessary . < p > In short , this is a okay movie , but the original is MUCH better .",m,0
THIS THE BEST OF THE BEST IN ANIME,m,1
"Wow ! This sequel to Vampire Hunter D took 15 years to arrive though I did n't mind that much because I did n't see the original until a year before Bloodlust came out . Was the long wait worth it ? You bet ! You will be able to tell that the animation is a bit different but it does n't take away from the overall movie . While not quite as dark as it 's predecessor , Bloodlust has some creepy moments and is probably more of an action flick which is not a bad thing . As with the first , this sequel is not a typical vampire film and is sure to please fans of the original and even new comers to anime . As for the DVD , the special features are somewhat plentiful . Very nice picture quality but as for the sound quality . . . Ugh ! The sound between the dialouge and the music during the film are so unbalanced that you will find yourself having to turn the volume very high to understand everything being said and other times you will have to turn the volume lower due to a sudden burst of music right after a character 's spoken dialogue . While watching this movie , I suggest you keep the remote in your hand for volume adjustment . Other than the sound problem , Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is certainly worthy to be seen more than once as is the original .",m,1
"As the title of this review states `Good Story ' and that 's exactly what this movie represents , story telling and nothing more . The fighting scenes are very dramatic but far too short they only last mere seconds . Do n't purchase this movie if you are really into animation for the action I am and this movie almost has no action at ALL ! . Again I will like to stress that the fighting scenes are too dramatic , the movie does not give you an opportunity to get into the action . You will see two people about to battle and just when you sit up to take in the full effect of what 's about to take place one person just dies ! ! Just like that ! ! The movie was good but I bought this movie because I thought it would have been action packed so I am very disappointed .",m,0
"I have no review of the version because I could n't get past the fact that there is no Japanese audio . With all the things that can be done with DVDs today , it does n't make any since that this one comes with 1 audio choice . Even for region 1 there is n't even a French audio selection . This seems like a shoddy product . A friend of mine even returned his copy because there is no Japanese selection .",m,0
"Ok , I saw this movie when it was out in theatres and it was amazing ! Unfortunately for me , it was english dubbed which I hate so when the dvd finally was released I bought it , especially for the fact that I would be able to watch it in its original japanese language format ! However , to my disappointment , IT HAS NONE ON THE DVD ! They acctually released the dvd , with only the dubbed version in it ! ! The special features also are terrible . . . this & quot ; fan 's favorite scenes & quot ; feature is completely useless and even dumb . < p > Therefore , for the anime itself , I would give it 5 stars , its a great movie , but if you 're like me and hate english dubbed versions and expect more from your dvds , I give this dvd a mere 2 stars and suggest that you rent it or borrow it from someone else or if you can , find a japanese dvd with subtitles with your region encoding .",m,0
"I can not say why . It is , after all , animated . There are few animated full-length films on my best-100 list . Nevertheless , Vampire Hunter D is on my of-all-movies , top-10 list . < p > I am not knowledgeable enough to rate the animation . Maybe the most important thing is it is not evident after the first few viewing minutes ; the movie just becomes an engrossing story . Animation only comes to mind afterwards ; when something is obviously better done through animation than special effects somewhat as black and white goes away after a few minutes of Young Frankenstein or Casablanca and comes to mind only when you think back on the film and realize color would not have been an asset . < p > Bloodlust has fabulous characters and a story complex enough and good enough to draw you in completely . It is much better than the first film .",m,1
"I 'm only a casual fan of anime . Almost every anime movie I 've seen shares the same annoying cliches : minimal character development , long sequences of self-righteous expository dialogue , the old freeze-frame-over-a-moving-background image during the fight scenes , etcetera . This movie has those same flaws , but it also has a great deal to recommend it . < p > The story itself involves D , a stoic half-vampire who hunts other vampires stop me if you 've heard this before in a post-apocalypse future . Except that this guy has a talking parasite in his hand that acts as his partner foil , and in the future depicted here , vampires are a dying breed . During the opening scene , a human woman is abducted by the great vampire Meier , and her family hires D to find her . < p > This is where the movie gets unique . D 's pretty much a cold fish , but the supposed bad-guy Meier is actually in love with the human woman , and his love is reciprocated . The only villanous quality I can see in the guy is that he 's a vampire . He leads D and a group of rival hunters on a long and picaresque chase through a bleak future , which is half gothic ruin and half dead urban sprawl . D 's travels are just as often depicted around decaying radio telescopes and highway overpasses as they are in cathedrals and forests . More of D 's past which is n't a whole lot is revealed along the way , and his interactions with Leila , one of the rival hunters , help flesh out her character well . < p > Leila may be the closest thing this movie has to a moral center . After all , Meier 's love for his human consort is believable , and it 's hard to peg him as a villian , while D comes across as blindly obsessive . This really is n't a good-and-evil thing , and the moral ambiguity adds a great deal to the story . Leila has the usual reasons for being a vampire hunter , but it 's her moral struggle toward the end that gives her character real depth . Luckily , she and D do n't fall into a romance which would have been predictable but all wrong , but they do develop a sort of friendship , which makes the ending sequence more poignant . Yes , this is an anime movie with a coherent ending . < p > There are fight scenes-lots of 'em , and they 're pretty bloody , but they 're well-choreographed , and the animation is great . The backgrounds are unique , and for the most part , the character drawings are masterfully done . The DVD does a great job of keeping everything clear and well-contrasted-not an easy thing in a movie with this much brown in its pallette . < p > All in all , it 's not the most original movie I 've seen , nor is it the most original anime , but this is a good , solid film that rewards repeated viewings .",m,1
"This is one of the best looking animes I have ever seen . It 's a great improvement from the first movie and it has some cool digital effects . I 'm no spoiler so I 'll keep it simple . Vampire Hunter D : Bloodlust is the sequel to the 1985 cult-classic anime . With more modern techniques in animation , VHD : B is a movie everyone has to see and experience with their own eyes . The monsters are sinister and the fight scenes are action-packed . The DVD has great special features including trailers and a behind the scenes feature . It 's a great buy . . . . so why not buy it ?",m,1
"D returns in this action packed follow up to the original . One thing you will immediately notice , is the clean animation . There is a great mix of C . G . and hand drawn cells . The story of D and his life is a sad one . Wandering through time seeing those around him die and fade away , as he remains unchanged and fighting for those that hire him . Just the thought of D lets you know he has an extensive past with many dark adventures . < p > Leila , a young bounty hunter , is after the same thing D is after - a young girl stolen by a vampire . Little do they know the problems that this girl causes . There is true love blossoming between the girl and the vampire , and that is among the most interesting turns of the plot . She wants to stay with him . < p > Like I said , the action is awesome . One of my favorite 's is when one of Leila 's companion 's uses an arm bow , slinging hundreds of arrows up into the air , then fall from the sky in a rain . Totally cool . You can see how far animation has come since the original , not that the original looked bad , just a tad dated . Also it was welcoming to have widescreen , which the original is not . Also the action is a little more discernable . You can easily tell who gets killed , and why . In the first it was a bit shakey in that area . < p > Also , a much changed and more quirky . Funny stuff . Bloodlust is a great follow up to the original . Enjoy !",m,1
"Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust - is what an anime horror , action , adventure , vampire story should be . A twisted future , with swords and guns , ruins and rockets , vampires and things that go bump in the night . The setting is an Earth in the far future . The very far future , an Earth that is just starting to recover from the past , where vampires are starting to die out . The focus of the story is a vampire who has fallen in love with a human . Now they wish to escape from everything that hounds them - the changing Earth , the girl 's family , hunters . Great artwork , good character design , good flow to the story - everything you could want in a movie . Even a cool twist at the end . The English caste voices are supplied by such greats as Wendee Lee , Debi Derryberry , Dwight Schultz , Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Michael McShane . There seems to be no Japanese sound track . In fact , it seems there may never have been one . The disc has a few extras , such as a Behind-The-Scenes featurette , trailers and storyboard to feature comparison . But the treasure of the disc is the anime , so get it new or used . Great for anime lovers or vampire lovers .",m,1
Shares much in common story-wise with the original Vampire Hunter D while not being `` just another copy '' . More modern graphics style and voice SFX and a more involved plotline make this a movie worth seeing for `` D '' fans and non-fans alike . Good ending .,m,1
"My title says it all . If you liked the first movie , heck , even if you hated the first movie or have no idea what or who Vampire Hunter D is . . . you should buy this ! To watch the first movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece of a anime film . I recommend this to anyone and everyone . You ca n't get any better than this people . Really . Also , read the book Vampire Hunter D : Demon Deathchase . It 's what the movie is based off of . Ok , time for plot breakdown : Charlotte , a rich man 's daughter has been *abducted* So we think by a mighty vampire named Meyer . D is hired by the man to retrive his daughter dead or alive . while the man also hired a group of renegade hunters to search for her too . D and the group meet from time to time and there is a spark of softness between Leila and D I wo n't tell when Anyhow , I dont wan na spoil a SUPURB anime for ya by telling the WHOLE plot but I will say the ending is so sweet . *sigh* Unless I did n't already say this , BUY IT ! I promise you wo n't regret it . And if you DO its oviously because you never watched it , silly !",f,1
"The animation is beautiful in this film , so good in fact that I 'd recommend Bloodlust for that reason alone . After more than fifteen years since the original , Bloodlust was definately welcome . The one bad thing about it is the lack of action , and the little action that there is is abbreviated in some way . With exception of two scenes , there are no action sequences that go longer than three minutes . The film , though , is n't long and the story is good enough to carry it from action to action . Great for those of you who liked Hellsing or the original Vampire Hunter D .",m,1
"vampire hunter d-bloodlust is a wonderful movie . it 's got violence , true love , adventure , and an awesome mysterious main character . this movie will totally rock your world . it 's different than most anime ; there 's no cutsie characters , and it 's definitely not a comedy that 's for sure ! . i would actually have given this movie 4 1 2 stars but it would n't let me ! the only reason i would n't have given it five stars is because i wish that we could 've gotten to know the main character a bit better not that it 's not great having him be a handsome mystery ! . it was also a bit harsh on my sensitive sensibilities toward the end . so if you 're as sensitive as i am BEWARE ! i would definitely give this animation a ten . it 's different but wonderfully dark . i do hope you get this ! i know you 'll enjoy it !",f,1
"Following in the footsteps of such invincible characters as Vash The Stampede Trigun and Alucard Hellsing , comes D , a dunpeal half vampire bounty hunter . This is the second installment chronicling the adventures of D the first being the original Vampire Hunter D . D is a killer of few words and even fewer friends , though he is not without a sense of honor and goodness . Initially , the plot is relatively mundane ; Charlotte , your typical damsel in distress , is abducted by a powerful aristocratic vampire named Meyer . D is commissioned by Charlotte 's family to bring back Charlotte , either dead or alive . At this point , this anime distinguishes itself from the pack when this seemingly predictable plot churns out a few signficant surprises that keeps the story running at a smooth , enthralling clip . As to what makes the movie so smooth and engrossing can be directly attributed to Vampire hunter D : Bloodlust 's superb animation . I can not reiterate enough how beautifully Bloodlust plays out on DVD . Bloodlust 's rich deep colors and sharp angles are reminiscient of Batman : The Animated Series . This being a full-feature movie , each cell of animation is meticulously drawn out . Such attention to detail brings to life the story 's dark , supernatural setting in addition to highlighting the & quot ; realistically & quot ; drawn style of the characters no cartoony , big heads here . Overall , the story wo n't lull you into a preliminary coma , while the great action and animation are sure to impress . Be sure to watch the ending , as it is my favorite part in the entire movie . It serves to reinforce the existence of D as something timeless and more than merely mortal . People come and go , kingdoms rise and fall , but D will always be there , brooding and silent as usual .",m,1
"This is the sequel to the original release back in 1984 , This time D is out to save a young woman kidnapped by the vampire meir link . The animation is as good as anything I have ever seen in anime . It ranks up there with Ghost In The Shell or anything else of this caliber . The music this time around is astoundingly good , it really made the movie and the plot is also very interesting . D is drawn to look very sharp in this movie , the detail in his face is exceptional , very smooth and fluid . Most anime is drawn to give good facial expression to bring across emotion , but D is about the best I have ever seen this time around . For any anime fan , this is an absolute must have for your collection .",m,1
This has everything the first movie had plus more . This is the same great characterization but with awesome animation . This has awesome music and a totally kickass opening . Probably the best opener to any Anime movie I 've ever seen ! BUY THIS BUY THIS BUY THIS ! !,m,1
"I just have to say that this is absolutely one of the best anime-movies I have ever seen ! The storyline is brilliant , and the graphics is really outstanding . If you are a fan of anime , I strongly advise you to add this masterpiece of film to your collection . < p > & quot ; D & quot ; has been hired to track down Meier Link , a powerful vampire who has abducted a human woman . D 's orders are strict - find Charlotte , at any cost . But he gets some competition . The Markus brothers are also hired for the same bounty . D must intercept Meier and conquer hostile forces in a deadly race against time .",m,1
"Before I review this edition of `` Tarzan 's Savage Fury '' , let me give you all the negatives ; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $ 6 less than Amazon ; there are no special features , subtitles , nor even a scene index ; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities which means you probably wo n't be able to play this on your PC . By the release of Lex Barker 's fourth film as 'Tarzan ' , audiences had accepted the boyishly handsome actor in the role , despite reduced budgets and overused stock footage . Producer Sol Lesser offered 'gimmicks ' to draw in audiences , and this film had a doozy . . . a young , orphaned white boy Tommy Carlton , being used as 'bait ' to capture alligators , is rescued by Tarzan , and for this film , at least , serves as his young ward the first time such a character had been seen since Johnny Sheffield 's 'Boy ' , during the Johnny Weismuller years . Carlton is cute , if not as feisty and athletic as Sheffield , and the Barker Carlton scenes capture some of the flavor of the 'Classic ' Tarzan films . The plot is routine , although it is a pleasure to see Edgar Rice Burroughs ' conception of Tarzan as `` Lord Greystoke '' referred to . His cousin is murdered , on safari , and substituted by a dissolute Englishman `` The Adventures of Robin Hood 's '' Patric Knowles , in a Communist plot to steal diamonds this being filmed at the height of the Cold War . While Tarzan is suspicious Charles Korvin , as the Soviet agent , is obviously untrustworthy ! , he is persuaded by Jane beautiful ex-model Dorothy Hart , in her only appearance in the series , to take the pair to a tribe with an abundance of diamonds `` to save England '' . Tarzan is incapacitated and left for dead by Korvin , Knowles repents , Jane is marked for execution by the tribe for the missing diamonds , and Carlton and Cheeta must rescue Tarzan so he can save the day ! Very short at only 81 minutes , and action-packed , `` Tarzan 's Savage Fury '' is certainly not in a league with earlier 'Tarzan ' entries , but is diverting , and offers an interesting view at the 'Red Scare ' of the 1950s . Definitely worth a look !",m,0
"As usual with Tarzan films , the title of this movie is overstated ; he does not express savage fury , although he does kill his enemy . It is fun to watch . This 1952 film is the sixteenth movie in the Tarzan series since 1932 . It is the fourth of five films in which Lex Barker has the role since he followed Johnny Weissmuller in 1949 .

"This movie is what the 1990s action movie on-a-budget , was all about : a low-budget , urban , martial arts action , western starring the incomparable Steve James . The story was nice . Great one-liners . . The acting was pretty good , too . Reb Brown is so over-the-top -- it 's perfect ! ! Wall -to-wall fisticuffs . *The final fight scene against the multiple assailants in the warehouse seems to go on forever Tony Jaa , 'The Protector ' , would love it ! ! -- and I was so pumped , after it was over , I wanted to go fight 63 guys too -- ! ! This movie is a classic , and should be released on DVD with all the extras . This would a fitting tribute to the great Steve James .",m,1
"NANA is a story about two girls with the same name who randomly meet while going to pursue their dreams of making it big in Tokyo .

Her friend , Hachi their nickname in the story for the non-singer Nana dreams of finding her perfect soul mate and love in the big city . There is more to the adventures of these two ladies but their friendship is the glue that holds the tale together .

this video is a must have for anyone who enjoys the doors . Val Kilmner 's portrayal of Jim Morrison is the best thing that he has ever done . you will swear that he is posessed by the spirit of Morrison .

"Last night 's bargain-rack movie was `` The Doors , `` a film by Oliver Stone . If you enjoy rock 'n ' roll and the life-style that seems to be associated with it , then you might enjoy this film . The Doors were a rock group whose leader , Jim Morrison , was a beach dude from Venice , California , and who 's personal theme song was `` The World Owes Me A Living . `` Jim met up with another Venice beach person who liked his poetry and first thing you know a couple other guys joined and they put together a band which quickly became popular . It was on to Whiskey A Go-Go , a Los Angeles dive for up and coming bands , then on to San Francisco , a recording contract and off to New York City , all in a very short time span . Burning the candle at both ends became a way of life . The Doors fame quickly grew and their records hit big-time and the funding rolled in . Jim Morrison 's ego quickly inflated to mega-proportions and he began to hold everyone in contempt , his venue owners , the police , his loyal girlfriend , his band-mates and , ultimately , even his fans , while he proclaimed that life was n't worth living and that he wanted to die . His intake of intoxicants was prodigious and he favored hard booze , guzzled straight from the bottle . His shows gradually became intoxicated brawls until , finally , he died of heart problems at the old age of 29 . Okay , I 've glossed it over a bit but that 's the general gist . It 's an interesting story and the general outline fits more than one rock group . The movie was quite excellent . Well done ! The acting was believable . You could actually feel as if you 're a member of the entourage and are going through this ridiculous rise and fall right along with Morrison and the band . Most of the Doors songs have faded with 60s memories , but it 's good hearing them again in the context of the times . . The Doors have become music critics legendary darlings so a lot of interesting extra materials are included on a second disc . It 's a worthwhile DVD packet , whether you liked the Doors or not .

"This has n't aged well since I first saw it in like 1997 in high school . Oliver Stone directs this power film starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison , front man singer for rock group The Doors . The main thing here is the rock star excess of jim Morrison played well by Kilmer . The rest of the band takes a back sit in this cool chiller about Jim Morrison who rocked the late 60s and early 70s . The Doors ' music is no longer shocking after living through the rise of black metal and the punk revival . I would recommend it to anyone , though a masterpiece it 's not any more . I still enjoy Doors ' music reissues on CD .",m,0
"what can i say , a classic movie about a classic rock band on high def blue ray . . . . . get it .",m,1
"This is the best rock movie ever made . Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time . This is a film he gets less credit for , but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done . First of all , he nails the life of Jim Morrison , the story of The Doors , and the L . A . Scene 1960s as perfectly as it can be done . It is beyond nostalgoia , it is time travel . As great as Stone 's use of Doors songs , scenery , drug use and beautiful , heavily-decorated '60s California girls is , it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest . Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks . Next on the agenda , you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on , irritating Ray Manzarek . To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors , everything is flawless . The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene , particularly Morrison urinating at Barney 's Beanery , which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe . The feeling watching `` The Doors '' switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led , and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it . Love my girl !",m,1
This was the part that Val Kilmer was born to play . The music in the movie just makes you trip away from the very beginning . It 's fantastic . I love the Doors . This is a must have for any Door 's fan .,m,1
This is a great quality product and quick shipping . The movie is great depicting the era of the great rock n roll bands . This type of musical talent no longer exists in `` today 's '' bands .,m,1
"This was a wonderful film , ValKilmer 's best in my opinion . As Jim Morrison Kilmer gets to the core of the inner and oft hidden demons with all of us . Although achieving wealth , fame and success Morrisson is haunted by a mystical figure who appears to be calling him toward his destiny a destiny which Jim seems so eager to meet and embrace . Morrison personifies all that was rock and roll in the 60 's , sex drugs and seeminly a taste for pushing ones'self to the limits of physical and psychological exhausion . I highly recommend this .",m,1
"Formed by Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek at a night on the beach after Jim read some of his poems to Ray , The Doors became one of the greatest rock bands of all time in the late 60s . Jim Morrison was one of the first rock n roll rebels and wrote some of the darkest , deepest songs ever `` The End '' , `` Strange Days '' , etc . Even Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 started a band themselves after being mesmerized at a Doors concert . The band started in 1965 , and released their first album in 1967 , and sadly the original band ended in 1971 , due to Jim Morrison 's unfortunate death . Oliver Stone 's film is more about Jim Morrison than the band , to be honest . Val Kilmer 's performance is so convincing , you 'd think you 're watching Jim in the film and in some shots , you are ! . It has been said that even the surviving Doors members had trouble distinguishing Kilmer 's vocals from Morrison 's own . Val Kilmer should 've at least been nominated for an oscar . The actors playing the other Doors members Kyle MacLachlan , Kevin Dillion , and Frank Whaley have some screen time , but as I said , the movie is basically about Jim . I think this is an excellent bio-pic , but some would disagree . So , check it out if you 're a fan , or even if you are n't a fan . It 's a masterpiece . Oh , and Oliver Stone is an admitted fanatic Morrison fan , in interviews he has said that he views him as something of a god .",m,1
"When I saw `` The Doors : Special Edition '' I hoped that Oliver Stone would have added additional footage into the movie that was originally taken out for time . That was n't the case . The film remains as it has since it 's release , and the only addition is a second DVD included with `` The Road of Excess '' documentary , a small featurette and interviews with some of the cast , and of course , Oliver Stone himself . While the extra DVD does shed some additional light on the film , I do n't believe it adds anything of significance to the original film Oliver Stone presented in 1991 . I gave it 4 stars because of the film itself , the bonus DVD deserves 2 stars .",m,1
"In 1991 director Oliver Stone made two epics concerning the 1960s , `` JFK '' and `` The Doors '' . In my humble opinion , Stone was most successful with `` The Doors '' in evoking the spirit of that tumultuous time in American history . You can feel and taste the ambiance of the Sunset Strip and the smoky clubs that the Doors used as their stomping grounds . But who 's kidding who ; the Doors were a vehicle for the musings of their charasmatic leader , Jim Morrison , and the rest of the band were able sidemen . Val Kilmer so eerily channels the spirit of Morrison in his performance here that you feel that you are actually witnessing the rise and downward spiral of the Lizard King himself . The cast here includes many talented individuals Meg Ryan , Kyle Maclachlan , Frank Whaley , Kevin Dillon but essentially they are but straight men to the Morrison show . The reason I rate this film four stars instead of five is indicative of the fact that this is ultimately not an easy film to watch . It 's something of a chore to witness the self-destruction of a talented individual through his own narcissistic indulgences .",m,1
"is what this movie should have been titled . Jim Morrison appears drunk and high in 99 . 9 % of the scenes in this movie which I found dissapointing . Val Kilmer does a GREAT job as the Doors frontman . Maybe it 's because I grew up in the late 70 's , but I did n't really understand Oliver Stone 's need to show us what it 's like to be on acid and all the while reciting weirdo poetry like Morrison does in this movie . . . I mean , what 's with the indians , snakes , etc ? I would have prefered a straight story on the band , this movie is about Jim Morrison . It 's an interesting and different movie that 's for sure . The dvd menus are cool . . . like something from the 1960 's .",m,0
"Looks brand new , not a scratch on the DVD . One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $ 3 ! ! !",f,1
"Jim Morrison was a self-indulgent hack of a songwriter , but he was a man with charisma to spare . It sometimes amazes he that his shoddy mythologizing passes for poetic expression , but then I listen to his voice : Not technically beautiful , but lusty , ringing , and enormous , it redeems some of his missteps and makes them into great rock songs like & quot ; Break on Through & quot ; and & quot ; LA Woman & quot ; . Oliver Stone , on the other hand , is no hack , but like Morrison , he is overambitious and self-indulgent . It makes sense that he would make a film about the Doors ' frontman . The result is an enormous film that is very nearly derailed by Stone 's irritating mannerisms and bloated , overheated directing , but maybe that 's fitting : A bloated , overheated rock star deserves a bloated , overheated biopic . The best part about the film by far is Val Kilmer 's mezmerizing performance as the Lizard King himself , and man is it a great part -- to me , it ranks with De Niro in & quot ; Taxi Driver , & quot ; Washington in & quot ; Malcom X , & quot ; and Brando in & quot ; On the Waterfront & quot ; as one of the finest of all time . Unfortunately , Stone is unwilling to let his star carry the picture and thereby outshine the director , and so the whole enterprise comes this close to crashing down in flames .",m,0
Highly entertaining film about the Doors rise to fame . The music is great . Not to be missed .,f,1
"This film takes you through the history of the Doors starting in Vanice Beach California where they break through and rise to stardom . Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild , ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band . Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life . It flows through the timeline showing all the true aspects of Jim 's poetic personality . Fabulously portrayal of Jim Morrison and very entertaining .",m,1
"Although I have never agreed with drug use at all , I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors . and many other groups of the 60 's and 70 's . . . I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer , and he is awesome in this role . The movie is very well made , the music is fantastic , the storyline is wonderful , yet so sad . . . I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors . . .",f,1
"For those of us who grew up in the 1960s , this is a wonderful film . It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time , that all old forms could be swept away , that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future . Of course we were wrong , and those who embodied all the hope and excess , like Morrison , paid the price with their lives - they were drunk , drugged out , and many eventually died of it . Looking back on it , I feel amazed at how naive we were , how arrogant , but then , we were children and youths , affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless . This film accurately portrays that feeling , both in its pathetic over-reaching , but also a lot of the beauty of it . This is the best Stone film by far , and I was n't even into the Doors . Warmly recommended .",m,1
"Brilliant . The film starts out with The Doors , and then takes on a life of its own , becoming a cult object in the process , an objet d'art , breathless , entwined , twirling , obsessive , relentless , varicoloured . . . It 's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final , musical , passionate , finale .",m,1
"If you just want to have a good time and not worry about details related to biography , this is the perfect The Doors movie .",f,1
"This was a good show in all . Very Trippy ! ! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it ? ? heehee ! Billy played & quot ; Kat & quot ; . He had brown long hair and was on crutches . He was briefly at the bar . Be careful . . . if you blink , you 'll miss him ! ! : o",f,1
"'The Doors ' were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the sixties and the quintessential California group of the decade . They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream . What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison ? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs , alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture ? Or is Jims ' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century ? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways ' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God ? Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime . Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic , shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing , or ready to accept . A truly remarkable accomplishment . As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison , it could n't have been better . His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary . Without question Val was born to play this role . Did Jim really believe he was the `` Electric Shaman '' called by the spirits to open the `` Doors of Perception '' to a sleeping world ? Was he Dionysus reborn , here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring ' with `` Golden copulations in the streets of L . A . `` More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster ' leading us once again in the wrong direction . Maybe it 's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert . `` It 's just a dream Jimmy , that 's all it is . `` So relax , show no fear , `` Kiss the Snake '' and enjoy the ride !",m,1
"Hey , I know I 'm in the minority in my opinion here on Amazon , yet I will state unequivocally my view that the portrayal of Jim Morrison , his common-law wife Pamela Courson , the group , and even the supporting cast of regulars in The Doors Universe come off like characters in search of a serious screenwriter . Come on already , Oliver . Who could sympathize with Jim and Company when they spew out lines of dialogue clipped , of all places , from Morrison 's song lyrics ? Did you actually think an audience would accept Jim uttering such discordant lines in an everyday conversation ? Could you not separate the man from the performer ? Because of that awful bit of writing , Jim comes off like a buffoon , not an erudite talent who , despite a lifetime of loneliness , alienation , and addictive tendencies which would ultimately snuff out his life , still managed to push aside material comfort for a pursuit of the truth as he saw it . Also , how come Jim revels in such horrible psychobabble ? Had you not gleamed the interviews available through Bright Midnight and other retailers you 'd hear an incredibly bright , articulate young man who lamented the day he elected to be part of a rock and roll band . You 'd also have the makings of excellent drama , as a man who can not escape his fame and a man who longed to create films and poetry in his own right . How could one ever sympathize with a drunken lout YOUR Jim who acts like an ass seems more like Val Kilmer playing himself rather than Jim , shows no compassion whatsoever , and just appears to become famous in one quick turn of events . The only clue we have to the success stems from the Sullivan show , the airport raid , and assorted concerts , but we never get a sense of Jim being nationally lambasted . Some archival footage might have helped there . But of course then the more sedate , intelligent Morrison -- whom you portrayed as bumping into cops whereas Jim preferred to sway at a mike stand see the archival footage -- does n't figure in a Hollywood biopic . What a shame . What a rotten , dirty , salacious mess . Maybe your own demons got the better of your good sense , Oliver . God knows , if your Morrison had been the true Morrison , I 'd never had been a fan of his in the first place . Thanks for turning Jim into David Lee Roth , the members of KISS , Robert Plant , and all those other Circus Magazine posterboys for rock and roll excess . Too bad . An integrity , a nonmaterial nature , and a sincere attraction to make art distinguishes Jim from all those other Sex , Drug , and Rock and Roller hellions .",m,0
"First , let me start off by saying that Val Kilmer 's performance in this film is nothing short of genius . He literally became Jim Morrison , almost to the point that I thought that Val was actually a mental patient who thought he WAS Jim Morrison . There are many times during the film that I had to tell myself that it was n't Jim that had come back from the dead . Second , Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and he can make the viewer feel as if he has just stepped into a time machine and gone back to visit the 60 's -- that 's how authentic the setting is in this movie . However , the problem that I sometimes have with Oliver Stone is that he has a tendancy to go a little to overboard in his films , and `` The Doors '' is a perfect example of this . We all know that Jim Morrison was a troubled soul , but , hey , let 's face it -- most of your artistic geniuses are , which what makes their work so incredible . Stone , however , made Jim Morrison out to be some acid-draining Nazi that cared only about himself and had violent outbursts all the time . In reality , though , if one does a little research , one finds out that Jim was only like that some of the time and not every second of his life . This movie , I felt , failed to show more of the beautiful maverick poet shaman that Jim , most of the time , really was . Also , I felt that the sex angle was overplayed a bit , as well . Obviously Jim had slept with a number of women , and the women that were n't able to , most likely fantasized about being with Jim . However , it was if this film made Jim out to be so horny that he would actually have sex with mannequins at the local department store . In reality , when all is said and done , the only real saving grace of this film was Val Kilmer 's outstanding performance as well as Stone 's accurate re-creation of the trippin ' sixties .",m,0
"If you love the real Doors , stay clear of this miasma . The Doors , I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time , but this vapid flick , created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late , great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish , idiotic and talenless goofballs . This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry . I may just have to re-read for the third time No One Here Gets Out Alive , and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer 's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt .",m,0
This movie transported me back to the 60 's . It brought back some great memories . The sound track is excellent ! ! ! ! !,m,1
"The particular filmography of Oliver Stone has had peak and lows . He is - before any other circumstance - a CSI filmmaker . His camera is an untiring explorer of facts , livings and memories . That is why my personal list of his treasures films possibly do not include his most succesful works . This is one of my three favorite Opus of Stone ; my other tweo choice are JFK and Wall Street . This movie works out as historical document , due its shocking realism but the the loyal refelect of USA in those ages . Being an exception figure O . S . innquires and carves in releief the expectations , defeats and livings of whole generation , tired of waiting who felt Jim Morrison was the icon of his generation , the direct descendent of the beatnik ages headed by Alan Gingsberg and Andy Warhol . The script is so well built and the performances are so natural and spontaneous ; the towering acting of Kilmer and the fabulous scenaries conform a majuscule and interweaved puzzle of multidimensional resonance . Recommended without reserves .",m,1
"This is an excellent film about Jim Morrison and the Doors . While it is true that it is not completely accurate Oliver Stone directed it so how would it be and is sometimes way over the top it is still an entertaining and intresting movie . I 've watched it several times I love the Doors and Jim and it holds up to the repeated views . If you like classic rock or the Doors then I would encourage this because it is a great picture of the 60 's and of Jim . Val Kilmer does a superb job as Jim . He looks , speaks and even sings like Jim . Meg Ryan is good as his wife . Anyways I highly reccomend this !",m,1
"The first time I watched this movie was at a party . I had no clue who The Doors were , was n't really paying attention , and never really saw the ending , however something clicked . The next day I went to rent the movie and really sit down and watch it . I never had a thing for Val Kilmer as an actor or really cared about Oliver Stone movies either . But after watching this movie made me fall in love with the Door 's music . After buying all their albums and books and reading into the band I found that the movie was not really exact in the band and the life of Jim . And the band members today say they were upset with the movie . However , die hard fan or someone that wants to visit the era in a movie , will enjoy this flick . Watch this movie as entertainment the way Oliver Stone wanted you to see it and not necessarily to get their life story . The movie is filled with some of the best Doors songs there are and can take you back to the era that many people wish never ended . Val Kilmer played an excellent role looking and even voicing Jim . If you are somewhat interested in the band , the era , or slipping away from reality for a couple hours , I highly recommend this movie !",m,1
"I just watched this movie again a few days ago , and the photography sticks in my mind . There are more special effects in The Doors than in Star Wars . I think this movie represents a change in Oliver Stone 's career . I did n't like some of his earlier films as much as other people . The most interesting films to me were the ones where he used a lot of special photography to convey the message like JFK , Nixon , Any Given Sunday , even Natural Born Killers although I think Killers hits a doorstop in the prison scenes . There are scenes in Killers that have the kind of visual exuberance and improvisations inherent in the message , almost like a fairy tale . The Doors uses cinema the way Apocalypse Now uses cinema . What I mean by that is the montages , the feeling of immersion , the adult manner in which the cinema handles the plot . It pulls out the stops and goes as deep as the mental state it portrays without being too `` preachy '' . Those are Stone 's preferable qualities to me . The Oliver Stone films lacking those presentation techniques I speak of were shot so gritty to the extent of degrading the moral , and they had little beauty or gloss in them , which are the things that were put into The Doors and the above few I mentioned . Stone 's better films are the ones like this one that treats his subjects as fairy tales for adults . They are the ones that take me on a colorful ride and display what those things look like in one 's imagination , and then plays with them like fairy tales . They should be vivid and colorful . They should not make me hate the world , but have me make better choices in the world . If you are interested in Oliver Stone in the same manner , you may also want to read his book , A Child 's Night Dream .",m,1
"Val Kilmer might as well be Jim Morrison reincarnate . He was too good for the part . It was beyond amazing . . . it was downright eerie . From Jim 's singing talking voice , all the way to his maneurisms and his drug-addiction and his beliefs , and what he looked like . . . Val Kilmer got it all . All I can say is , somehow , JIM MORRISON WAS HAUNTING THIS FILM . Because of that , and because of the incredible supporting cast , really hot women , and the splended choice of songs used for the movie , The Doors is an amazing masterpiece about an incredible rock group . I wish I had been alive in that time to truly see the Doors live instead of being forced to see their concerts on TV and on DVD . This DVD is an awesome bio-movie about the band , and about Jim Morrison . And about Val Kilmer . . . I had first seen Val Kilmer act as Batman in Batman Forever , and after that , I did n't think too highly of his acting skills . It was an okay Batman , but he just did n't do that good . But then I saw this movie , and I began looking at what else Val Kilmer has done , and I realized , it was n't Val Kilmer who sucked in Batman Forever It was just his bad luck that he had to read that particular script . . . it was Robin and the mediocrity of the movie itself . As I said above , it was eerie watching him play Jim Morrison . The DVD also has great features , a lot of Deleted Scenes that I think should be put back into the movie , and over-all is very worth-it . Now , an unrated one with all those Deleted Scenes put back in would be incredible .",m,1
". . . Mr . Kilmer is dead-on as the Lizard King , the & quot ; band & quot ; nails the look of a band really performing and the trippy visuals are all in the spirit of the era from which the Doors sprang . Man , either rock or get the hell out of the way . . .",m,1
"This movie changed my perspective of Rock n ' Roll intensely . This movie was so gratifying , it gave me chills , it also made me sort of understand Morrison more . Val Kilmer portrayed such a terrific roll as Morrison , I acually believed it was Morrison instead of the actor . I love the doors . I dont think the movie could be any better or any worse . Thumbs up to Oliver STONE . JIM MORRISON LIVES",f,1
"This movie was excellent . Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison impeccably . This movie really gave me a look into The Doors and really entertained me . I 'd Reccommend this movie for anyone who likes The Doors or music from that time . I enjoyed it , before the movie I did n't know too much about Jim Morrison or The Doors but now I am a Doors fan . This movie is a must-see",m,1
"This overlong biopic of Jim Morrison Val Kilmer is most interesting early on as it details the rise to fame of the Doors . Soon , however , Morrison surrenders himself completely to drugs and the film spirals into a long series of repetitive scenes in which Morrison abuses himself and others . The main reason to watch this film is Kilmer 's incredible performance . To impersonate a man whose look and sound are so well-known without descending into characature is a true acting achievement . Unfortnately , writer-director Oliver Stone dotes on Morrison 's sophomoric paens to death and self-centered spiritual explorations so minutely that he often comes across as an unquestioning syncophant . The greatest narrative achievement of the film is showing how such a self-destructive person can maintain a career -- at least for a while -- through the efforts of those around him who feel that the talent he offers justifies the garbage they have to put up with .",m,0
"I should preface this by stating I really do NOT like Oliver Stone movies other than Natural Born Killers , for some reason I feel very disconnected to them . And he does it again with the Doors . On the recommendation of my son I watched this on a borrow and I have to say I watched the entire run of the movie and still know NOTHING about THE DOORS . The movie is instead filled with psychedelic filler of the highest order and Jim Morrison comes off as nothing more than a sullen drunken crybaby . All the relationships seemed forced and nothing about this era or group seemed interesting at all , and I have to think that 's simply not true in real life . A lot has been made of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and for all the hype I 've heard I can say I was mildly let down , which could be more a fault of the script since NO ONE not even the lead had any type of depth or worthwhile backstory , so what more can an actor do ? I actually thought Meg Ryan was the stand out , and that does n't say a lot .",m,0
"I went to see this film the night it was released in Seattle . Not because it interested me so much but more because I had a friend who really wanted to see it when it came out and could n't . He liked to see films immediately upon their release . I liked to do things that irked him , so I made sure to see the film before he did . This was a surprising film , really . When I heard that Val Kilmer had been cast as Jim Morrison , I , like many , was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off . The Val Kilmer we had to that point come to recognise looked nothing like Morrison in addition to which , Kilmer 's roles had never really stretched his `` acting muscles '' , so most were convinced that he would fail . However , Kilmer respectably fooled everyone with his convincing portrayal of Morrison . His performance was enjoyable . Meg Ryan was surprising also because her role was a bit of a departure . Still did n't like her , though . Kathleen Quinlan 's blood drinking gothic diversion for Morrison was an interesting character . The story was not thrilling , as we all know the story , and in fact , many parts of the film were simply laughable . I noticed at the end when Morrison decides to move to Paris and is saying goodbye to his friends other Doors members , he and the friends hug and not only do they perform that special `` man hug '' which is a hug always accompanied by several hard slaps on the back . . . very manly but also accompanied with tender sentiments like , `` I 'm gon na miss you '' followed by the tempering insult , `` you a**hole '' . No niceties for the sake of niceties . We all know Jim 's fate . . . you can visit him in the P & egrave ; re Lachaise cemetery in Paris .",f,0
"this movie is hogwash . oliver stone blew it with this one . With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made . its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did ! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat , morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell . Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to care anything about him or his art . the movie is a mixed up mess `` IS EVERYBODY IN '' Gee i hope not !",m,0
"Oliver Stone , a great director in general , really slacks off in this one ! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but , Meg Ryan as Pam . . . only in a dream world . All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded . Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story along . All in all a very good story but , not nearly an accurate depiction of Jims ' rise and fall",f,0
"This film somewhat disappointed me . I walked away from this film thinking that Jim Morrison was an alcoholic jerk who cared only about himself . Thankfully , soon after watching this movie I read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive ' and I have come to see a better picture of the true Jim Morrison . It seems as if Hollywood is only interested in the abusive side of Morrison and not the more down-to-earth side of Morrison . Oliver Stone made Jim 's character so one dimensional . . . and this is a serious flaw in a movie that is based , for the mostpart , on one man . That being said , Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Jim Morrison . The movie has many fantastic parts : the making of 'Light My Fire ' , the cinematography in Jim 's desert peyote scene , the Miami concert . It is a great film to watch , but definitely read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive ' if you want to understand the more human side of Jim Morrison . 4 5",m,1
"Surely Jim Morrison 's life was n't as debauched as Oliver Stone presents it in THE DOORS 1991 . The film plays like a rock music gang bang . OK , not exactly , but if Jimmy was THAT physically active would n't he have had a case of terminal johnson blisters ? Recently seeing this movie again reminded me of how handsome Val Kilmer was in his youth . Physically he makes a superb Morrison , can even sing like the man . Yes , the music is just great here and the actors playing the other members of the Doors work well in their roles . Crispin Glover 's Andy Warhol is also interesting in a creepy sort of way , but this film is good only up to a point . The early story works best , and then you get to that vampire sequence , geez . And how about Meg Ryan 's elevator surprise ? If I saw what she encountered that night I 'd be outta there on the next flight to San Berdoo . Yet Pamela Courson stuck around for more heartbreak , and more , and more , and . . . Director Stone must have a message here . Surely it is n't : do n't shoot too many scenes with a red filter ? With Morrison Kilmer overdrugging , overdrinking , oversexing , overeating and overschmoozing , it has to be : all things in moderation . In a two year period , Janis Joplin died of heroin and booze , Jim Morrison passed away in a bathtub from a heroin OD and Jimi Hendrix asphixiated while regurgitating the 9 sleeping pills he 'd swallowed , which apparently was 8½ too many . All were only 27 . All had made wondrous music . The word `` tragedy '' does n't begin to describe how Janis , Jim and Jimi left us , and what the world lost in potential new songs as a result . Their deaths marked a turning point in music and in how we fans lived our own lives . Epilogue : Three years after Jim left her , Pamela Courson also died of a heroin overdose . Like the others , Pamela was only 27 years old .",f,0
"I think The Doors are one of the greatest bands in rock history . I also think that no one else will ever possess the presence or talent that Jim Morrison did , especially with the way rock `` music '' is going these days I mean , Limp Bizkit was popular a few years ago , if that says anything about where rock is headed . I 'm not an Oliver Stone fan particularly . I 've never seen JFK , and Natural Born Killers seems to have a sort of following behind it , but I honestly did n't see any redeeming qualities about that movie . So when I saw that Oliver Stone was the director of the movie about my favorite band , although I was excited to watch it , I truthfully was n't expecting very much . I bought it before watching it and still own it . Although I 've seen it many times , I 'm still conflicted as to how I feel about it . It seems that the movie , although true to The Doors and how they got together and their rise to fame , did not do Jim justice at all . It had nothing to do with Val Kilmer , he was perfect as Jim , especially the live performance scenes ; I 've watched many Doors live performances and how Val embodied Jim in that respect was really amazing . I do think he over-did it sometimes-the pouty thing he did drove me nuts and the photo shoot scene made me laugh it was so cheesy . All in all though , I loved Val as Jim . Yet the movie seemed to show only one aspect of who Morrison was-on the road to excess , out of control , drunken , womanizing . Sure he 's a rock star , but I would have loved to know more about who he REALLY was , because I feel the movie did n't delve into that . I 'm positive there was much more to him than the drunken rock star even if it was the truth , that 's not all of who he was . Ray Manzarek said it best `` It was not about Jim Morrison . It was about Jimbo Morrison , the drunk . God , where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy ? The guy I knew was not on that screen . `` I give the movie three stars because aside from my criticisms of it , it 's essentially a good movie by an okay director about an amazing band . Damn you Oliver Stone , why could n't a better director with a better screenplay have done this movie , who knows what could have been .",f,0
"`` The Doors '' is the greatest of all rock movies , in the years since it was first released in 1991 it has gained a weird kind of cult status , it is popular among young rockers and teenagers as it is among the adults who belong to the generation first grabbed by `` Light My Fire . `` The film is directed by cinema madman and virtuoso , Oliver Stone , who was a Doors fan when serving in Vietnam and here conceives a movie that is big in scope and excess , in other words , it stays true to the spirit of it 's subject . People including Doors organist Ray Manzarek have attacked Stone and movie for dramatic license and fictional inventions , but the Morrison myth has grown so large that it is hard to even trust the accounts of people like Manzarek who enjoys pouring gasoline into the myth 's fire and so the movie should be taken for what it is , a MOVIE . And man , it is one of the great rock spectacles ever dramatized on film . Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance , dressed in the black leather pants and long hair , he gives a stunning performance because we never doubt it is Jim Morrison dancing around on the screen , the effect is even more enhanced because Kilmer sang most of the concert scenes in the DVD commentary , Stone informs us Kilmer sang ALL of the 1969 Miami concert sequence and as a performer , he has a pretty good voice . The movie captures not only the madness of Morrison , but also the atmosphere and lore of his music . The movie uses no score , it imploys the Doors songs to create the mood while squeezing in `` Venus In Furs '' by Velvet Underground and the classic opus `` Carmina Burana '' . There are moments of insansity and excess that create a hypnotic intensity driven by the rich , dreamy photography by Robert Richardson , and there are even , amidst the sex , drugs and rock n ' roll , some moments of romantic sweetness in a poetic way when Morrison rhymes for his girl Pamela Courson played by Meg Ryan . Stone used completely live audiences for the concert sequences , which are exhilarating and stunning , especially a gothic sequence in San Francisco when the band performs `` Not To Touch The Earth . `` Any Doors fan will love this film , especially since the soundtrack , featuring all the greats like `` Break On Through , `` `` Backdoor Man , `` `` Light My Fire , `` `` Strange Days , `` `` The Crystal Ship '' and `` Five To One '' pulses with the Doors sound , and hearing Kilmer deliver his own performances is a treat no Doors afficionado or rock enthusiast should miss . `` The Doors '' is thrilling , hypnotic and a fiery experience of great rock n ' roll .",m,1
"I avoided this movie when it first came out , and I avoided it for about 10 years afterward , because I heard that it was such a travesty . Recently , I received the DVD as a Christmas gift . Out of respect to the person who gave it to me , I decided to watch it at least once . I was very pleasantly surprised . . . and physically and emotionally exhausted by the movie 's end . True , Oliver Stone 's version of the Doors ' legend is n't dead-on accurate , but I think the realism and accuracy were only sacrificed in order to make a greater visceral and artistic impact , which I believe is something Jim Morrison might have understood . The whole point of this movie is to revel in its excesses , and on that point , the movie scores everytime . And remember that this is the story as filtered through Stone 's own perception , not a docudrama . Kudos to Val Kilmer , whose portrayal of Jim Morrison was just as uncanny as I 'd heard . Where 's his Oscar ? I really dug this movie , even as a Doors fan who knows the true history as heard from the band . And if you can experience it as the Bacchanalian epic it 's meant to be , and just take in all the sights and sounds , then you 'll really dig it , too .",m,1
"I was not a big fan of `` The Doors '' musical group until I watched this film . I feel Val Kilmer did an incredible performance as Jim Morrison . To learn later that Mr Kilmer actually sang most of the songs in the film himself , blew me away . I feel this film was before it 's time . And Mr Kilmer should have been nominated for the performance . They nominated that actor for `` Ray '' and he did not even sing in the movie . I gave this movie 5 stars , for all the incredible acting done in this film especially Val Kilmer & Meg Ryan .",f,1
"This movie is a very insightful look into the Doors and Jim Morrison 's life . However , if you really want an accurate history I would read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore .",m,1
"I am not a `` diehard fan '' of The Doors , though I do appreciate their work . I do believe that all the actors who play the band-members do a superb job . . . But my positive comments stop there . The director , Oliver Stone , fills this movie with so many drug-induced hallucinations , you can not tell if a scene is something that actually happened or if it 's the work of Morrison 's drugged-up imagination . Now , I do n't like your run-of-the-mill biopic , but this unconventional biopic wallows in self-indulgence to the point of absurdity . Stone and the producers seem so determined to make this more of an `` art film '' than an actual biopic , and , boy , does it back-fire . Granted , every biopic is `` Hollywood-ized '' , but this movie makes you wonder way too many times where the artistic license ends and the actual facts begin or vice-versa . In short , this production showcases the leader of a rock-band - Jim Morrison - who is bent on self-destruction . The same could be said about this movie .",m,0
"Myself , being a huge doors fan , I absolutely love this movie . Oliver Stone did a great job capturing Jim Morrison 's wild life fueled by drugs and alcohol onto the big screen , but maybe he gave us a false perception of the Lizard King . Many people watch this movie to get an idea on what Jim was like , and this movie is not what it 's for . Oliver Stone exaggerated a lot of thing in Jim 's life to make it more movie like , which is completely okay , but people must understand this . As a movie , it 's fantastic , and keeps us pulled into Jim 's story throughout the whole thing , but do n't look at this movie as a documentary .",m,1
"This is the best rock movie ever made . Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time . This is a film he gets less credit for , but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done . First of all , he nails the life of Jim Morrison , the story of The Doors , and the L . A . Scene 1960s as perfectly as it can be done . It is beyond nostalgoia , it is time travel . < p > As great as Stone 's use of Doors songs , scenery , drug use and beautiful , heavily-decorated '60s California girls is , it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest . Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks . < p > Next on the agenda , you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on , irritating Ray Manzarek . To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors , everything is flawless . The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene , particularly Morrison urinating at Barney 's Beanery , which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe . < p > The feeling watching & quot ; The Doors & quot ; switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led , and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it . < p > Love my girl ! < p > STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF & quot ; BARRY BONDS : BASEBALL 'S SUPERMAN & quot ; . . .",m,1
"I must say Oliver Stone and his company did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the late 1960s . The film looks like a sixties movie . Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for the role of Jim Morrison . Though some of it was rather exagerrated , like the scene where the band performs on The Ed Sullivan Show . Ed had forbid Jim to say & quot ; higher & quot ; in the song Light My Fire , and Jim said it with an emphasized expression . I 've got the actual episode of The Ed Sullivan Show taped . The real Jim did disobeye Ed by saying & quot ; higher & quot ; , but without the emphasized expression . Meg Ryan does a good portrayal of Pamela Courson too .",m,1
"Oliver Stone has a creative imagination and uses it well in this biography of the legendary '60 's rock band & quot ; The Doors & quot ; . Unfortunately , Stone forgets that most of the people portrayed in this movie are still very much alive and have a much better memory than he does ! The music is fantastic , Val Kilmer is pretty good as the legendary Jim Morrison a little too pretty maybe as Morrison always looked a little rough around the edges ! but I hope nobody leaves this movie thinking this is how it was . Buy & quot ; The Doors : VH1 Storytellers & quot ; to get a hint of what this band was about !",m,0
"What can I say about `` The Doors '' that has n't been said already . First of all Val Kilmer was so good in this movie that when I hear a Door 's song I picture him instead of Jim Morrison . I wished I was born in the 50 's so I could have seen The Doors . Oliver Stone dipicts Morrison as a poet trapped in a rock star 's body . The epic rise and fall of the Doors is great but sad at the same time . They had so much more to offer us . Remember people the Doors were only around for 5 years . Until Morrison 's untimely death . The rest of the Doors are protrayed as innocent bystanders . John Densmore was pissing me off with his constent whining and crying . Robby Krieger was a cool guy , and Ray Manzarek was supercool . All these guys look like people that could have gone to high school with . The film has a nostaglic feeling to it , almost as if is a dockumentary rather than a film . Every time I see `` The Doors '' it feels as if its the first time .",m,1
"I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job , the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim , to an older one , was unreal . Meg Ryan also great in this . The music , acting , the story was very entertaining , this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time . < p > Great Job Kilmer !",f,1
"I think some of the people who wrote some of these other reviews may have had some pretty high expectations of what the film would accomplish . No , it does n't definitively depict the life and times of the band . Yes , it focuses primarily on the self-destruction of James D . Morrison . Yes , it 's one-sided blame the Coursons for that . So what ? Get it for the concert scenes alone , and Val Kilmer 's ininmitable performance as Morrison . I 'd recommend reading & quot ; Riders on the Storm & quot ; by drummer John Densmore either before or after seeing the film to get an idea of what Oliver Stone was getting at and also to appreciate the cameo appearances by the likes of Patricia Kenealy and Densmore himself as & quot ; Last Session Sound Engineer & quot ; . Bets of all , get one of the concert videos and check out the real deal .",m,1
"Along with The Crow , and Fight Club , this film would stand as one of my all time favourites . I have read many a novel on Jim , and own all of his albums , hence I could be a little biased on the actual filming merit of the movie , however to me , it is a striking portrayal of perhaps one of the most chrismatic and interesting artists of history . One of the main themes of the movie , and something that remains unknown to many of the band fans , is that Jim was really a poet seen by his great spoken album American Prayer , not a rockstar , and this is a contributing factor to his eventual downfall , his need to play the part of a singer . This film can be confrontingly vivid and somewhat shocking , and although it does contain several untruths regarding the events that surrounded Jim , I believe it is an excellent portrayal of his personality . Many would disagree , however few could argue that the those that hate Jim and the Doors with a passion , after seeing this film , would be slightly entrigued about Jim Morrison .",f,1
"The Doors is with out a shadow of a doubt the greatest rock and roll film ever made ! It tells perfectly what the late-great Jim Morrison went through and how he lived . This goes into the music and the L . A . scene in the late 1960 's . Everything you ever heard about The Doors or Jim Morrison comes across in this movie . The Plot is very east to understand . You find yourself felling bad for Jim because of all the stuff he put himself through , but you also feel bad for the Band because Jim made it to wear Robby , John , and Ray couldnt play their music live because of Jims on stage anticks . I found my self hating Jims wife because if he wouldnt have met her he woulndt have done half of the stuff he did , so was really a bad influence . This is a whats gon na happen next film , and Val Kilmer pulls of the roll flawlessly",m,1
"The Doors is one of music 's most enduring rock groups , led by one of the 20th century 's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison . The movie , directed by Oliver Stone , is not a biopic , more of an `` homage '' to the life , and the character of Jim Morrison . The movie details his life , and his rise and fall in music , culminating in his death at 27 . The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition , including Oliver Stone 's commentary . Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes . Highly recommended .",m,1
"I think this is a great movie . They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything . One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life . For instance , when the doors appeared on cbs , they were asked not to sing the line `` girl we couldnt get much higher '' . As most know , Jim sung it anyway , but it was an accident . Stone made it appear as it was on purpose . Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim , ehich was not true",m,1
"Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison . The name Val Kilmer is , or should be , synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing , but immensely fun and commanding . You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture . Here , he IS The Doors : The Movie . There , he WAS Wonderland . I am exaggerating , i suppose . For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you 've experienced what the sixties were like . Through using The Doors actual music what was missing from the recent Sylvia , the art of the subject itself - her poetry to help tell its story and colour its scenes , and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison , Stone really takes you into the world of his movie , and the world of the sixties . < p > This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were , and has actually cultivated love in me for their music . I did n't realise they had more than one classic : Light my Fire , The End , People are Strange , Love her Madly , Break on Through to the Other Side , Riders on the Storm , Touch Me , Roadhouse Blues Let it roll , baby roll and probably more i 'm yet to discover . < p > For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol 's factory actually felt like , see I Shot Andy Warhol . Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in & quot ; I Shot , & quot ; but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy 's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation . This , however , is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole . < p > Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo : a young film student , Jim Morrison , shows his short film to his class , who are uncouth and disparaging about it , after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn , obviously , playing the film professor , who says : & quot ; Why do n't we ask the author what he thinks ? & quot ;",m,1
"My son got me this for last christmas , I already had the vhs version , but this 2 disk set is even better . The interviews with everyone and learning alot more about the movie and everyone who participated in it , and what they really had to say about it , just blew my mind . < p > Still a GREAT movie , Great cast , VAL & amp ; MEG awesome job ! ! ! No one could of pulled off playing jim , not like you did ! This movie is not only entertaining , the music is awesome , as well as the acting . < p > Any doors fan , will love this , true or not , the movie is awesome !",f,1
"Kilmer is Morrison in this movie , he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did . This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one . Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie . Long live Morrison",m,1

I am a John Wayne fan & have over 70 of his movies in my collection . I agree with Mr . Wu 's description of the plot . It is one of the better of John Wayne 's grade B Republic movies . It is the only movie in which John Wayne `` sang '' & the dubbed in voice is definitely not John Wayne 's voice . John Wayne did not want to be a singing cowboy & it allowed others like Gene Autry & Roy Rogers to fill that role . I was pleased that the film was reworked & the DVD had good audio & picture .,m,1

"My daughter is very bright but had trouble learning her multiplication tables . I tried everything , including hiring a tutor , but she still had trouble and was sad and frustrated . After a while I remembered that back in the 70s I had learned the multiplication tables myself on Saturday mornings watching Schoolhouse Rock ! I was so excited to learn that there was a DVD available featuring the same excellent songs I had learned from as a child . Multiplication Rock did the trick ! My daughter learned the multiplication tables backwards and forwards by watching the DVD every day for about a month , and I did n't have to nag her to study !",f,1

Not knowing this , we sat down to watch the 'movie ' after receiving the DVD . After several 'lessons ' , we felt a bit bombarded ! It would be much better to only watch 2 or 3 target lessons , discussing concepts during or after .",f,1

"The reason people read a review is usually to help decide whether to buy a product . do n't waste your time , just buy this disk . it is simply the best collection of musical animated shorts ever created . the melodies , lyrics and images are so clever , profound and yet enjoyably simple that they will awe you with their beauty . for those of us who enjoyed schoolhouse rock in our chilhood , every song will spark a fond memory . for those who have n't had the pleasure unfortunately , and to the great detriment of the current generation , schoolhouse rock seems to have been shoved aside by such puerile revenue generators as hawking merchandising spinoffs from the latest pop culture garbage trend , you will be amazed at the quality , catchiness and intelligence of these productions . < p > when i got the disk , i picked the american series and was immediately enraptured by `` no more kings '' . its a beautiful , clever and funny encapsulation of our rebellion from british rule . kids will love it for the funny scens , adults will appreciate the content , and everyone will like the music . i could n't help but marvel how much better it was than the random quicks we 've been playing for our child . and this was only the first song of one of the many different groups ! the series covers grammar it 's still the way i remember parts of speech , multiplication tables , american governmental principles , science and money . schoolhouse rock won an emmy in 1978 and it probably deserved a few more - it is truly in a class by itself .",m,1
"I also grew up on Schoolhouse Rock . I was more looking forward to the Schoolhouse Rock segments than the other cartoons ! !

Now that I have sons of my own , I wanted to get them something educational that will teach them math , science , grammer , and history . I want them to learn about those things without realizing they were learning and have fun doing it . Schoolhouse Rock is definitely the way to go ! !

"I always wondered what happened to the episodes of Schoolhouse Rock . I remember waking up on a Saturday morning and singing along . Not really knowing that I was learning . Schoolhouse Rock has been a great learning exprience for myself and my brother and sister . Even though I have no children of my own , I bought this product for a friend of mine grandson . He is only two years old , she tells me that he already knows that song to Conjunction Junction . My all time favorite is The Bill . That song help me pass the constitution in the eight grade . I had to remember what the bill was for on the test . Not to Toot my own horn but I aced the test . So if anyone who isnt entirely convenced in buying this product . Do so it will help your children out alot . And the good thing about it is that they wont even know that they are learning until it is to late .",f,1
"An absolute must for anyone with small children . Covers basic math and grammar as well as science and history , all delivered in musical jingles that are easy to remember for children .

Even with the poor sound quality this gets four stars , fix the audio and it would get 10 stars .",f,1
"Whether you are buying this for yourself to reminisce about times gone by or you are going to use it as a teaching tool I 'm using it for both as I 'm in my late 30s & grew up on School House Rock , this DVD will not disappoint .",f,1
Just what I wanted watched it with my daughter and she is already singing the songs I am sure she will learn from this dvd,f,1
"My husband and I were given this set as a gift when our sons were 4 and 2 , and I think we have had more fun with it than the kids have . I remember watching these growing up in the 80s and it 's amazing how many things I learned that stuck with me through the years . We love every minute spent watching these . My kids are starting to watch them and ask about the things they 're learning . Good stuff !",f,1
This is the best set of short educational cartoons ever made . I 've never seen a child not be memorized by them . Buy this,m,1
This DVD is a great blast from the past ! ! I grew up with these videos in the 1970 's and I forgot how funny and generally educational these videos were . It 's great to see them all again whenever I want . How wacked is the video about the U . S . spreading to the west coast because we needed `` elbow room '' ? I do n't think the Native People would appreciate that one . I was disappointed in the extras . Otherwise awesome ! !,f,1
I ENJOYED SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK growing up . I still remember the songs today at 43 ! I thought the catchy tunes would help her with multiplication .

"This DVD is in excellent condition and my children love it , not to mention the memories it brings back . Schoolhouse Rock should still be run on regular TV .",m,1
"My daughter 9 years old loves this video and we now share this common connection . I 'm one of the millions who grew up with these educational music videos . I 'm glad that I have the chance to share with the next generation .

Other than that , the sound and video production is fine .",m,1
"This DVD is phenomenal . My sons love it . They used to play Schoolhouse Rock on ABC every Saturday morning in between the Saturday morning cartoons . As a kid , ABC educated us without us knowing it . The basic rules of grammar , math and U . S . history that I learned from Schoolhouse Rock , I was able to use in school . Children nowadays need more of this and less violence . Schoolhouse Rock can be incorporated in elementary school education .",m,1

The multiplication rock section is fantastic , not only because the child can learn through music , but the songs are the kind that stay in your head all day . My grandson 's school uses this DVD to teach every subject . My son reminds me this was on tape when he was in elementary school , so it has been around for years . Enjoy !",f,1

It is a learning tool and entertaining as well . I like that it has a variety of American subcultures represented throughout the different presentations . I think I 'll stock a few extra for gifts to my neighbors .,m,1
"These short segments that where done on American History are an excellent tool for teaching concepts about American Government that most people have no understanding . As a college professor I have used this series to teach my students about the Constitution , principles on how our government works and the history of our country , Schoolhouse Rock is more relevent today then it was 30 years ago . The princples it teaches has been lost by many Americans . My students juniors and seniors at the college leave can not answer basic question about their governmnet and how it works until they are shown Schoolhouse Rock . I show these programs every semster in order to give my students a sense of how and why things occur in the their countries covernment . I have gotten other colleaques at the college and high school level to use this series . One of my colleagues an English teacher loves the vignettes on grammer and punctuation . This series is no longer a series for children but a teaching aid for all levels of students .",m,1
"I bought this because I recalled it fondly from my childhood and figured the lessons it taught are still applicable , therefore I might actually re learn somethings . I also thought my two-year old might , just might , like bits of it . Was I wrong . He absolutely loves it and is beginning to repeat the lyrics . I strongly recommend this to all .",m,1
Had a great time watching the Grammar Rock DVD at the dentist 's office . ALL of the hygenists came in asking what we were watching while having my teeth cleaned . Everyone knew them and told which ones were their favorites I 'm Just a Bill and Conjunction Junction . My kids are grown so this video was for me . One of the other ladies at work also bought one . They are great for nostalgia ! Get them and you can be smarter than a 5th grader !,f,1
"I have fond memories of watching this series on ABC 's Saturday Morning lineup as a child during the early 1980s . I wish that ABC would resurrect the series , as I think that it makes otherwise bland academic subjects fun and engaging . Given the questionable state of culture and education in our nation today , I think that Schoolhouse Rock looks better and better .",m,1
"This is a wonderful learning tool for children or anyone who needs a refresher on the basics . I was already a teenager when Schoolhouse Rock started but whenever I need to recall my grammer I can still hear `` Conjunction , junction '' in my head thirty years later ! Now my children are finding it just as useful . Great tool !",f,1
"I learned the preamble of the Constitution when I was young listening to Schoolhouse Rock . My boys are ages 5 and almost 9 and they are learning about nouns , conjunctions , electricity , history and algebra . They love the songs and cartoon characters . Very educational , but very cute ! Wonderfully fun way to learn .",f,1
The DVD is great . It has all of the old songs and cartoons you remember from Saturday mornings as a kid . I 'm a teacher and I 've been using it in my classroom as an extension of lessons . I 'm getting a whole new generation hooked on the songs . . . `` Conjunction junction what 's your function ? ``,m,1
"I remember watching these as mini-commercials between different Saturday morning cartoons . Funny how some 30 years later , certain favorites are still in the old brain . I found myself singing along with `` Conjunction , Junction '' and `` I 'm Just a Bill '' and going down memory lane as others played . My little ones are just as in love with these as I was at their age . . . and it 's so much nicer than watching `` another DVD '' . Absolutely recommend this set ! ! ! !",f,1
I not only bought this video for my kids and kids of friends but also for some of my adult friends . It 's not only educational it 's also so much fun to watch . It sure brings back memories of my Saturday mornings as a kid . Kids today are missing out !,f,1
"My daughter and I have really enjoyed this DVD . It is a bit confusing to get to the `` play all '' function , but it is there and will play in order or shuffled . You can also choose to play all the rocks in a particular category . Her favorite is Tyrannosaurus Debt which was not even playing when I first watched these as a youngster . This is an awesome DVD to have when I need 20 minutes to cook dinner or feed the baby and want the older child occupied with `` intelligent '' TV . Excellent purchase !",f,1
"I gave this to my wife , who is a history teacher , for Christmas and we decided to pop it in the DVD player to check it out . It was amazing , how the memories flooded back . Everyone in the family recalled their favorite Shoolhouse Rock ! song and would n't let us take the DVD out until it was played ! Sometimes , more than once . Even if you remember just one of these songs from your childhood , this DVD is worth every penny .",m,1
"I love Schoolhouse Rock . . . In the late 70s early80s -- I used to wait for the commercials during Saturday morning cartoons for this . . . and when I started to watch the Smurfs on NBC -- I would switch over to ABC at 9:30 , 10 , 10:30 . . . to catch my Schoolhouse Rock . . . . now I 'll have them forever . Clever , witty , spunky , and fun . . . you have to love them . Ca n't wait to use the songs to teach more students about history , grammar , math , and everything . . . . Way to go !",m,1
"Years ago , I used to watch Schoolhouse Rock with my children and recommended it to my students as well . Today , it is entertaining and educating the next generation of our family 's youngsters . The Special 30th Anniversary Edition will be a treasure that parents and grandparents can enjoy with the kids . It 's money well-spent !",f,1
"If you are e member of Generation X and watched Saturday morning cartons , you have surely seen Schoolhouse Rock . I never realized there were 40+ of these in all . They are all great and teach math , science , history , grammar and other topics . You can watch them individually or in their subject groupings . A master `` play all '' function seems to be missing . They did a great job transferring the 30 year old animation to DVD . Everything is very clear . Great for a youngster discovering these for the first time , or a Generation Xer bringing back memories of Saturday morning cartoons .",m,1
"I just ca n't say enough about this DVD . . . it takes me back to when I was a kid watching cartoons on Saturday mornings . I think this is great not only for kids in grade school , but for adults like me who want to watch it for pure enjoyment sake !",f,1
Everyone knows how great Schoolhouse Rock is . This is my second purchase of the Aniversary Edition . We used it so much that we wore it out . These are a must have to keep in the van or car . We make the most of travel time . There is definitely a market for Educational DVD 's for use in the van ! The kids are captive and they do not know they are learning . Rock and Learn are also a must have ! Please somebody . . . . . keep them coming !,f,1
"I only wanted to add that contrary to what one reviewer wrote , this product does have a `` play all '' feature . It 's under the title `` The Whole Enchilada '' .",m,1
"When my children were young , they loved School House Rock . We sang Conjunction Junction . They never forgot the important concepts in grammar , math , social studies , and science . I boutght the DVD for my grandchildren , ages 3 to 12 A whole new generation loved School House Rock . What a great gift for grandkids .",f,1
This is a great DVD to own in a collection of family entertainment ! It brings back the memories to my Junior High days in the early 70 's just watching this on Saturday mornings ! About 30 years later it 's still entertaining and yet you yearn for more of this ! Still educational as well ! A+ all the way !,m,1
"Still the undisputed king of educational videos . At 43 years old , I can still remember the words to all these songs .",f,1
"I cherish these cartoons from my childhood . I have bought two copies and intend to buy more for family and friends . If you have children these DVDs are a great value . Their educational value makes them priceless . Some songs are better than others , but overall this is just a great concept . My neices , age 5 , watches the DVD everyday .",m,1
My 8 yr old and my 11 yr old sat side by side for hours watching the same DVD over and over and over again . What bargain ! And what happened ? They learned something too ; more then they learned from watching SPIDERMAN and Monsters Inc .,m,1
"I homeschool both my girls so I bought this video to help my girls have a fun way to learn . They just love the songs ! ! ! My six year old runs around singing `` Conjunction Junction , what 's your function ? `` My eight year old loves the history videos . I would recommend this video to everyone , whether you homeschool or not . It 's a great educational video .",m,1
"I love this DVD ! I grew up in front of the television with my cup of Captain Crunch and watching Schoolhouse Rock every Saturday morning . I remember more about basic mathematics , grammar and history from this series than from my elementary school classes . I can still sing the Preamble to the United States Constitution , `` Figure Eight '' , `` Conjunction Junction '' and `` I 'm Just a Bill '' more than 30 years later . It 's a timeless educational classic for those of us who grew up in the '70s and for the generations that have followed !",f,1
"I just met Bob heard him play these songs at a coffee shop in the Colorado mountains 3 is a magic number , bill and conjunction junction . It was an amazing trip down my childhood and I 'm now ordering the DVD .",m,1
"I used to look forward to these shorts more than the cartoon that were aired around them . These informative shorts were hip and fun for my generation and I dare say still hold up . This dvd is loaded with extras and great interactive menus with hidden features , keep your eyes open . It even contains modern artists interpretions of some of these songs some excellent renditions and fun videos . Do yourself a favor and buy this for the child inside and the children you have now ! !",m,1
"Revisiting these snippets from my childhood was incredible ! I can remember a time when just seeing `` Interjection '' would mean that I had a great weekend . Now I can have a good weekend every weekend . I 've spent the past three days engrossed in the DVDs . The animation may be of a lower quality than we 've become used to , but the lyrics and music are incredible . I have n't been able to stop singing `` Sufferin ' til Suffrage '' and `` Rufus Xavier Sasparilla '' . I recieved the DVDs as a gift and a dozen of us sat down during a party and watched these wonderful animated gems . Share them with your kids , your parents , your students , and DEFINITELY your friends . Entertaining , energetic , and educational we all need a brush up now and then , do n't we ?",m,1
"This DVD is great . To be able to go back and see all of the oldSchool House Rock videos was really cool . I now have a little girl of my own and I want her to be able to learn grammer , history , math and science in a fun way like I was able to do 30 years ago . The songs and video hold up as well today as it did 30 years ago and my daughter loves to watch and dance to the music . I recomend this to all parents and people who just want to walk down memory lane , you 'll find your self sing conjunction junction and I 'm just a bill in the shower .",m,1
"Without a doubt one of the best Saturday morning cartoons even produced and the best way to learn about grammar , history and politics . How many times have you ever found yourself saying `` I 'm just a Bill '' or `` Conjunction Junction '' , in most crowds you will get a smile and maybe even a sing along on those crafty and informative tunes . < p > This DVD offers all of the popular songs with special emphasis on what many fans votes were the Top 10 . There is also a new song featuring a voter booth named Boothy who sings about the importance of voting . The menus are fun and easy to click through . The only beef I had are the idiotic and unnecessary Disney commercials placed on the disk , you cant skip them easily and they are annoying ! Otherwise this is a most welcome addition to my DVD library and will be a prized for some time .",m,1
"Back in the 70s , I learned a lot about grammar , math and the Constitution from these short cartoons . Watching them again after 30 years , they are compact and entertaining miracles , combining catchy tunes with a surprisingly large amount of information . I plan to give a number of these as Christmas gifts to people with children . Leave your kids in front of the TV with this DVD , and they will likely surprise you with how fast they pick this stuff up .",m,1
"When I saw that Schoolhouse Rock was coming out on DVD , I was immediately taken back to 7th grade American History when our teacher asked if anyone knew the Preamble to the Constitution . I raised my hand and stood up and recited the entire thing . My teacher was very impressed and said that I had it down perfectly , except that it was n't actually a song . That was news to me ! As a mother I thought back on that day and realized the educational value of these little songs that pack so much important information , and I just had to treat my kids to the fun .",f,1
"In this captivating collection of Schoolhouse Rock ! you get all the old favorites ranging from My Hero , Zero to Little Twelvetoes . There are also great grammar numbers like Conjuntion Junction and Lolly , Lolly , Lolly , Get Your Adverbs Here , as well as mini civics lessons such as I 'm Just A Bill and a new one on the electoral college , I 'm Gon na Send Your Vote To College , which adults could learn a little about as well . Bob Dorough composed and sang many of the songs , but you also hear Blossom Dearie and The Lemonheads among others . Of course what makes this collection special is that you have all the animated pieces to go along with the songs , which provided valuable fillers between Saturday morning cartoons all those years ago . Too bad The Cartoon Channel did n't pick up on these animated classics , instead of Disney , as it would make the viewing experience a little less mind-numbing for children . So , I bought this collection to fill in the gaps .",m,1
"All the favorites that you remember , plus more - they make learning fun !",f,1
My children grew up with Schoolhouse Rock and now my grandchildren can learn from the same fun and educational songs . I still remember the words to some of the songs . Do n't pass this by it is something you and your children will enjoy and learn from !,f,1
"While I 'm sure the core audience for this material is elementary aged , my daughter age 3 absolutely LOVES Schoolhouse Rock ! and has for quite a while . While the finer points of the material are undoubtedly lost on her she can not read , after all she still gets the gist of much of it and has her favorites . Besides , the material is at least as interesting as Mazzie , Dora , the Wiggles , etc for a child of this age : the animation is quite good , the content wholesome , and the songs are both entertaining and memorable . And there are some very teachable moments as well . `` Gravity '' is a good opportunity for discussion about being careful not to fall or drop things . `` Telegraph Line '' is an opportunity for talking about pain and staying away from hot stoves . I highly recommend this for kid of all ages , 3 to 93 .",m,1
"Saturday Mornings . . . . Cartoons were on that were n't just half-hour advertisements for toys . Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera ruled the airwaves during the morning hours . Sneaking in now and then were live-action classics from Sid and Marty Krofft . And between shows , if you were on the right channel at the right time , were these quirky little musical cartoons . They had catchy tunes , and kept us glued to the TV between shows . And they educated . They actually taught us things . Things we could use later in school , and throughout life . Basics of grammar , mathematics , history , science , civics and more , all in 3-minute chunks . Now , Saturdays are cultural wastelands , `` educational TV '' is mostly unheard of outside of PBS because e i rules do n't apply to cable , and the only cartoons that do n't exist solely to sell toys are adult-oriented . Thankfully , with this DVD set , we can return to the glory days of Saturday Mornings , and share the experience with a new generation . Remember , it 's great to learn , 'cause knowledge is power !",m,1
Bought this because I was still singing the songs in my 40s and my daughter had been assigned to watch School House Rocks Conjunctions for homework . They helped her and was fun for both of us .,m,1
"I loved School House Rock growing up . It was so neat to see these again . I am almost certain they are all here . We just received this Friday afternoon , and I popped this in with other cartoon 'oldies ' yesterday morning .",f,1
"Our whole family loves this DVD . It 's a great tool to learning the basics . From the preamble , to the westward expansion to `` Where the Money Goes , `` this is a great selection of videos to have on the shelf . Everyone will love it . Catchy tunes and great info !",f,1
"School House Rock is timeless ! As a father of 5 children I see ever increasing holes in our education . The students are learning more at a greater pace and earlier in their lives . They truly are receiving a great education . However , I get the sense that some material is grazed over or skipped . School House rock is a fantastic way to give your children and the adults in your life reinforcement in the basics of education . Strengthen their educational foundation by putting this DVD in your player and letting it loop when the TV is not in use . The children will hear it , will stop and watch , and will absorb the information . I give this a high recommendation !",m,1
"This Video has most of my favorites - Conjunction Junction , I 'm just a bill , you know them . It 's amazing that in 25 years no one 's been able to top them . I wonder how many high school seniors know as much as a kid who watches these videos about history , science , grammar , and math . I prefer DVD , but whatever . My kids watch it all the time . I like it too . The songs are as fun . These clever rhymes are unforgettable , but unlike some annoying kid 's songs , you do n't really want to forget these . I really feel like my kids need to be informed about the Bible too , whatever they choose to believe later , so I have also been thrilled that they made a CD and DVD calledScripture Rock .",m,1
"Amazing how the kids pick up on the songs so quick . A great learning tool , old school but aswome . I still sing the songs when I am trying to remember grammar . And who does n't love a `` bill '' . I have to say even my teenagers are in the room watching when it is on , which can only help them too .",f,1
I bought this set for my grand-daughter in hopes that she would enjoy it as much as I did growing up . Anyone who has ever enjoyed Schoolhouse Rock knows that it is a great educational tool making learning fun ! Go School House Rock ! :,f,1
"Bought this for ourselves and for our son . We love that it has all the original songs and videos . If you watch all of them at once it does go on for quite a long time , but it 's nice because as we play we can listen to it and then it 's still there to watch when we 're ready for more down time . Great nostalgia and our son really loves the music , so we 're hoping it will hold his interest long enough for him to start learning some from it , too . The only thing about this collection is that I do n't think we 've ever once watched whatever is on the second dvd , we really only wanted it for the original songs anyway so while it 's not that big a deal , I do feel it could have been cheaper to have just left that out .",f,1
I gave this dvd to my brother 's son and it remains one of the best presents I ever gave . The cartoon segments accompanied by great music are educational and lots of fun !,m,1
"Bought this movie about 3 weeks ago . My child has not stopped wanting to watch it since it arrived . I had been playing the songs on a CD that I burned , and she loved them , learned them extremely fast , so I thought she would love to see them illustrated and put into motion . She knows all of the songs and recites multiplication table and told me yesterday that she loves the `` Barter song '' . She is 3 . I see that this review is n't really even necessary , however I must profess my love for it all the same . Bringing back memories and creating new ones . We are a lucky generation to have such an experience .",f,1
I purchased this DVD so my daughter could experience a piece of my childhood . She walks around singing the songs and it just melts my heart . She has learned a lot from the songs too .,f,1
"I COULD N'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED THIS DVD 2DAYS , THIS IS A CLASSIC THAT EVERY FAMILY SHOULD OWN , I GREW UP WATCHING THESES LESSONS AND STILL USE THEM TODAY WITH MY FAMILY . ITS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS IV MADE .",f,1
"I am so glad to have this in my video collection . Brought huge smiles to my husband and I and I 'm sure my daughter will appreciate it when she is older . I loved these little bits of educational songs and fun characters when I was a child , and I 'm so happy they are around for me to share with my daughter !",f,1
I 'm always singing the lyrics to some of these to my grandbaby without remembering them correctly . I played it for her the other night . Her eyes lit up and she giggled as she heard the songs I had attempted to sing . Now she can watch and listen to them . What a great time we had . My son learned these when they were on TV as originals . This is a great learning tool and I recommend it to everyone with young kids !,f,1
"I love this CD ! I use it to help my students with their grammar and it makes things a lot of fun ! The songs from my youth are fun a wonderful reminder for those who heard them as kids , and wonderful new experience for the younger students .",f,1
"Loved it then , love it now . I am introducing it to my kids and they really enjoy it . . .",m,1
"I have loved these songs since I was a kid . They are timeless little songs that are easy to learn and therefore help you remember importants facts such as `` a noun is a person , place or thing . `` From multipication , to english , to history , this is a fun way to learn .",f,1
Has all the classics as well as the later Schoolhouse Rock songs . The best part is you can custom create a playlist of the classic numbers . Great dvd !,m,1
"These timeless vignettes covering the four core basics of education are a fun and entertaining way of picking up those little facts that so often allude us . Having them on one dvd is a great help for a parent or teacher , or even a student . It is all localized and easy to use . It does have a factor of dating to the topic , but it is still very acceptable . JoAnne Dandin",f,1
"I am so happy to have rediscovered these great clips that introduce in a funny and easy way how to learn your numbers and verbs and nouns . It brought back such a time in my life where things were simple , I LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TOO .",f,1
"A generation of American kids grew up with School House Rock . Now our kids can , too ! Includes everything that you ever saw , plus new stuff , plus a few that were made back then but never released . 2 DVDs plus a nice booklet . Some of the animated songs are better than others , but then again we ca n't watch `` I 'm Just a Bill '' and `` Conjunction Junction '' all day long ! This must be one of the most beloved products on amazon . Out of over five hundred voters , 88 PERCENT give it 5 stars , and 96 PERCENT give it at least 4 stars .",m,1
I grew up watching school house rock . The DVD brought back so many memories . Now I can share these simple lessons with my kids ages 2 and 6 . I decided to buy it after seeing the play school House rock live . I 'm really glad that I bought it . My son enjoys the option of mild or spicy . Which is watching the songs in order or in random order . I have never see this option on a DVD before .,f,1
"Our two-year-old boy is loving this DVD and all the songs . Cracked us up when he sang , `` Conjuction Junction , what 's your function ? Hooking up words and frozen waffles . . . `` Buy it - you wo n't be disappointed . Only thing that could be better is the DVD navigation .",m,1
This is great . So many memories for me and new adventures for my daughter .,f,1
This edition has both grammar and science . I like being able to use the specific topic easily .,f,1
"As a reviewer , I can not add more to the long and very excellent discussion of the `` Schoolhouse Rock '' cartoons . As a teacher , however , I can say that not only are these little gems entirely appropriate to the classroom , but a wonderful vehicle still for teaching the `` basics '' of language , the parts of speech , and the workings of government . I would strongly recommend them .",m,1
I 'm very satisfied . I use this to help introduce topics in my 5th grade classroom . The kids love it . Still relevant after all these years .,f,1
I teach fourth grade and bought this product to use in my classroom . The students love it . They are now requesting to hear different songs . They think they are just being able to watch a movie but I have seen a spike in quiz scores since I started showing these three minute miracles .,m,1
I bought this for my grandson 's birthday . They all love to receive DVDs and they 'd viewed Schoolhouse Rock videos from the library . This was even better than they expected . My daughter loves the way it is set up so you can choose from the various themes . The children all loved it . It kept the attention of the two year old and the older children were not only entertained but learned a lot . This is definitely a five star DVD and nostalgic for those of us who remember when they were on TV .,f,1
I wanted quality movies for my kids to watch and this really fits the bill,f,1
"Although I say I bought this video for the kids , I really bought it for me ! I grew up loving these songs and it was a great trip down memory lane watching them . Although the kids are a little young for the material 2 & 5 They enjoyed the cartoons and the songs . I figure if they memorize the songs now , math will be easier when the time comes . They learn better with songs and music at this age .",f,1
"what a sheer joy to recieve this double cd in australia . . jack sheldon . bob dorough , dave frisberg , blossom dearie and possibly a few others of jazz heratige ; all adding their distinctive voices and delivery to a bunch of early primary school lyrics with a purpose . . blossoms `` figure 8 '' is a masterpiece of childish innocence enhanced by simple animation the upturned nose on the little schoolgirl while the irreplaceable jack sheldon in `` conjunction junction `` is still alive and singing in los angeles to this day . , by the way if you ever have the opportunity to visit the annual deleware water gap `` celebration of the arts '' in september you can expect to hear bob dorough presiding over the childrens tent ! ! . . a hardy lot these jazz icons . . . . .",m,1
My husband says this is his best birthday present ever . He turned 37 today .,m,1
I loved these videos on Saturdays when I was a kid ! Now my kids get to re-discover them . I love this set !,m,1
"My 6 year old loves it , my husband loves it , I love it . We watch it together and apart . The cartoons are fun and educational-and this DVD has them all on it ! A must buy !",f,1
"I 'm very pleased to have found this School House Rock dvd ! My kids 11 & 6 actually sit , jump , and sing `` together peacefully '' enjoying the shows !",f,1
"This DVD is great ! All my favorites as well as others that I had forgotten ! from my favorite Saturday morning snippets that I remember growing up ! I 've bought one for each of my nieces nephews as well as other friends ' kids ! These were so fun and valuable to me when I was growing up you could hear most of the class humming to the Constitution 's preamble during a test in High School social studies ! and I hope the music mixed with learning will be valuable to this next generation , too !",f,1
This brought back a lot of fond memories of `` watching the commercials '' in between the cartoons on Saturday morning . Anyone over 40 should definitely remember them . I plan on showing them to my grand kids so I can be sure that in today 's lackluster education system they will at least have learned AND RETAINED something beneficial .,f,1
Brings back a lot of memories . Has all of the old favorites . I bought this to help me teach kids about the constitution becuase I remembered those videos from when I was a kid . Kids still love these videos .,m,1
I have used the School House Rock DVD with young children and with preservice early childhood teachers . Music is a powerful medium through which to acquire and retain information . What 's great about this DVD is it has all of the songs created for all of the subject areas . Everyone loves it . The children are captivated by the songs and images . The teachers love recalling how much they enjoyed watching the videos when they were growing up and they can remember the songs as if they heard them just yesterday . Parents can use this DVD at home and teachers can use it to supplement their instruction .,m,1
"I bought this video for my sons because these songs had a great effect on my schooling . I was hooked from `` Conjunction Junction '' and never stopped being a fan . We like to play this DVD in the mornings , selecting the `` spicy '' version , which plays the songs in random order . Our children watch it as they have breakfast . This makes me happy for two reasons:1 . I know the catchy songs will help them learn , just as they did for me ; 2 . and , because my kids can enjoy this DD instead of being bombarded by TV commercials . We actually rented this DVD from Netflix first to see if our kids were going to like it . We also have rented the first seasons of Sesame Street , The Electric Company , The Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock . We do n't own a lot of DVDs but I 'm glad we added Schoolhouse Rock to our collection .",m,1
"I jumped at the chance to have these classics for my very own and it totally exceeded my expectations ! Anytime my kids hear me say , `` I used to watch this when I was young ! `` , they usually pass on watching it . Not this time . After the first 15 seconds they were GLUED to the television . Also , I 'm able to play the dvd 's on our computer so they can just sit and hear the songs while they play . They 're reviewing their Math , English and History facts AND they 're enjoying it !",f,1
Wow this brought back those saturday morning at mom 's house . I 'm glad i purchased this dvd .,m,1
"Let 's put it this way - I learned more from School House Rocks than I did from grammar school , way more . I hummed those tunes throughout my US Gov't class finals in high school - And when I popped this DVD in for my daughter for the first time , I was honestly astounded at how many of these little gems I still knew by heart . I think any child of 70 's will agree , no review necessary - School House Rocks rules .",m,1
"A few years ago , when I found out that Schoolhouse Rock was out on DVD , I was definitely overjoyed , and to make it even better , it was celebrating its 30th anniversary , so I ordered a copy of it for myself . I remember my years in elementary school 2nd-6th grade , especially , watching Saturday morning cartoons and then seeing a Schoolhouse Rock toon . Anyone who has kids which I do n't or grew up in the 70s which I did needs to have this 2-DVD set because it is wonderful ! I love every single thing about this 2-DVD set . I love the fact that it 's got all 46 oringinal animated Schoolhouse Rock toons plus the new Schoolhouse Rock toon called `` I 'm gon na send your vote to college '' , plus you can play the toons in their seperate categories grammar rock , america rock , multiplication rock , science rock & money rock or all of the toons together , either in order or in shuffle play . I also like the top 10 jukebox feature . The bonus features on disc 2 are really amazing , such as the long-lost Schoolhouse Rock toon `` The Weather Show '' , the 3 out of 4 Schoolhouse Rock toon set called `` Scooter Computer & Mr . Chips '' , the top 20 countdown of Schoolhouse Rock toons , the 4 music videos by certain music groups and the Nike commercial set to the tune of `` Three is a magic number '' . The audio commentaries are interesting , but what 's really neat are the surround-sound version of `` I 'm gon na send your vote to college '' the behind-the-scenes featurette about the making of `` I 'm gon na send your vote to college '' , the featurette about the Schoolhouse Rock creators winning 4 Emmy Awards and the 2 interactive games : the arrange-a-song puzzles game & the `` Earn Your Diploma '' trivia game . Altogether , this is a perfect 2-DVD set and I recommend it to anyone who has children or just wishes to relive their childhood because it is GREAT and if I were a teacher & they were in my class , I 'd tell the Schoolhouse Rock creators that they passed with flying colors !",m,1
"I bought this video for my 3rd grade daughter to help her with Multiplication . Now my Kindergarten son is learning them with her , along with other subjects . I am so glad I bought this DVD . I was concerned it might be a bit dated , but my children do n't seem to mind .",f,1
"This DVD is wonderful . They took every Schoolhouse Rock song ever made and put it into one DVD , with a couple new songs as well . It 's exactly what we grew up with , there was no `` remastering '' or anything that would take away from the original quality of the clips . It 's great for adults who like nostalgia and for kids who have trouble remembering the names of the planets or the 8 times tables . A must buy !",f,1
Great dvd set . All the educational cartoons are clean and bright with flawless sound . Great special features . Enjoyable for those of us who grew up with these cartoons and for the new generation . A very stimulating way to learn .,m,1
"I ordered this DVD for my son , because I had such wonderful memories of School House Rock episodes from Saturday mornings during my childhood . I learned my time-tables through school house rock , and even learned the preamble to the constitution ! While I did very much enjoy reliving the episodes from my childhood , I found the DVD very difficult to navigate .",f,1
I love watching the Schoolhouse Rock segments with my kids and have seen them learn a lot from watching them . The songs are timeless and still hold the attention of kids .,m,1
"I loved it as a kid , and now my toddler is also in love with it . I feel much better about him watching this than most other shows on TV . The songs are so much fun , and there are a lot of good , positive messages in with the educational material .",f,1
"My husband & I grew up on School House Rock & now our kids love them too ! My kids age 3 , 6 & 9 all love to sing along to the great songs ! We especially love to watch them on road trips ! GREAT FAMILY FUN & they are learning too ! ! !",f,1
"I got this DVD as a Christmas present for someone . To me , this collection is possible the best thing ever to share with a young child . The music is catchy , which makes learning more fun . When I was younger , I would watch these shorts every Saturday morning , and enjoyed every one of them . I would recommend getting this to help a young boy or girl get a good head-start in learning - or maybe you can get it yourself just for old-times sake .",m,1
I used to watch this when I was younger and was glad to see I could buy it for my nieces . It came quickly and was a great hit as a Christmas present .,f,1
"it is a good way for me to study for things that we talk about in history like for ex : how a bill becomes a law , and when we talked about what it says in the preamble , and The three branches of government .",f,1
"A must for ALL childrenI have donated many copies to schools , to view when bad weather prevented them from going outside to recess . EDUCATIONAL ALL THE WAY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",f,1
I enjoyed these songs growing up so I purchased this product to use in a classroom . The kids love it ! It made multiplication go much smoother !,f,1
