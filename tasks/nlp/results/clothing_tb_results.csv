"Love this dress ! it 's sooo pretty . i happened to find it in a store , and i 'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it 's petite . i bought a petite and am 5'8 '' . i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee . would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite .",y,1,0.33958333333333335,0.7250000000000001
"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me . i initially ordered the petite small my usual size but i found this to be outrageously small . so small in fact that i could not zip it up ! i reordered it in petite medium , which was just ok . overall , the top half was comfortable and fit nicely , but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap net over layers . imo , a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c",o,0,0.07367494824016563,0.35629399585921323

Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs . i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight ! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric . pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year ! needless to say it will be going back .,m,0,-0.0971494708994709,0.6034920634920635

This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings . i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings . the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2 4 with a small bust . in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up but then perhaps the waist will be too big . the problem with this dress is the quality . the fabrics are terrible . the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,m,0,-0.05714285714285715,0.5178571428571429

"I love this shirt because when i first saw it , i was n't sure if it was a shirt or dress . since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings . i bought a slip , wore the tie in the back , and rocked it with white wedges . you could also wear it as a vest . be careful with the buttons . i have n't had any fall off yet , but i feel like they will . overall it 's great for any occasion and it 's fun to wear !",o,1,0.25833333333333336,0.4191358024691358

I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive . this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat . the sleeves are very wide although long . as a light weight fall coat the sleeves do n't need to be as wide because you would n't be layerng too much underneath . the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit . i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,y,0,0.10181818181818182,0.47454545454545455

"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit . it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style , and as others mentioned , there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through . in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering ! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath , or wearing it over a little dress . it 's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat .",y,1,0.28291666666666665,0.6416666666666666
